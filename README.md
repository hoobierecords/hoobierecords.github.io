**Hoobie Records** is an independent underground music label operating at the outer limits of sound, taste, and artistic sanity. Based in **Grand Rapids, Michigan**, the label exists as both a release platform and a creative sanctuary for artists whose work defies genre, convention, and polite expectations.

Founded as a DIY outlet rather than a traditional business, Hoobie Records functions less like a label and more like a **curated zone of sonic chaos**—a place where experimental music, outsider art, noise, absurdism, and unfiltered creative impulses collide. Its catalog embraces the grotesque, the humorous, the offensive, and the unclassifiable, rejecting commercial polish in favor of raw expression and conceptual extremity.

At its core, Hoobie Records is guided by an ethos of **total creative freedom**. The label prioritizes artistic intent over marketability, welcoming projects that are too strange, confrontational, or unconventional for mainstream or even typical independent labels. Releases often blur the line between music and performance art, frequently incorporating shock aesthetics, surreal humor, and deliberate absurdity as tools of expression rather than gimmicks.

Hoobie Records’ output spans a wide spectrum of experimental forms, including noise, sound collage, outsider music, avant-garde compositions, and hybrid works that resist easy classification. Compilation releases such as *Hoobie Records: Clown Porn (Vol. 1)* exemplify the label’s approach—bringing together wildly disparate artists under a shared commitment to sonic extremity and conceptual mischief. Track titles and artwork are often provocative by design, reinforcing the label’s refusal to sanitize or soften its identity.

The label operates primarily through **Bandcamp**, maintaining a direct connection between artists and listeners while preserving full creative autonomy. Though largely absent from mainstream music press, Hoobie Records has cultivated a **cult following within underground and experimental music communities**, where its uncompromising aesthetic and unapologetic attitude are seen as a feature rather than a liability.

Ultimately, Hoobie Records stands as a testament to the enduring power of DIY culture and outsider art. It exists for artists on the fringe, listeners with strong stomachs and open minds, and anyone interested in music that feels dangerous, unhinged, or gleefully wrong. Hoobie Records is not here to fit in, trend, or behave—it is here to **document madness, celebrate creative depravity, and push sound into places it probably shouldn’t go.**
