Scum Puppy - Goblins Attack (Hopkinsville Horror)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Midnight in Kentucky, summer air thick as sin,
	Saucers in the treeline—lights kickin’ off again.
	Little green demons crawlin’ up the drain,
	Glowin’ like a matchstick in the pourin’ rain.
	Granny grab the shotgun, daddy clutch his cross,
	Creatures do the moonwalk, vanish in the moss.
[Pre-Chorus 1]
	Three feet tall, glowin’ in the Kentucky dark,
	Claw hands reachin’, eyes like fire spark.
	Shotgun blasts just made ‘em glide,
	These ain’t no men, these things outside.
[Chorus 1]
	Greenfield Road got cryptids outback.
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins raid!
	Kelly Green Men!
	Alien squad at night, they invade.
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins attack!
	Kelly Green Men!
[Verse 2]
	Lock the doors, load the iron, kids screamin’ up the stairs,
	Mama prayin’ to the cross, daddy starin’ at the flares.
	Took cover in the cellar, prayin’ for the sun,
	Little hands scratchin’ at the roof... run.
	Government files got it buried deep,
	But the witnesses still don’t sleep.
[Pre-Chorus 2]
	Tinfoil hats, shotgun blasts, nothin’ left but holes,
	Dawn break—they ghost, but the terror still rolls.
	Ain’t no tracks in the mud, ain’t no blood in the yard,
	Just a broke-screen porch light flickerin’ like a scar.
[Chorus 2]
	Greenfield Road got cryptids outback. 
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins raid!
	Kelly Green Men!
	Alien squad at night, they invade.
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins attack!
	Kelly Green Men!
[Bridge]
	Reporter laughed ‘til his pen caught flame,
	Now his typewriter types in a dead man’s name.
	Newsman call it "hysteria," doc say it’s the heat,
	But twelve witnesses don’t lie when they clutchin’ them sheets.
	Metallic claws scratchin’ at the window pane,
	Farmers turnin’ preachers callin’ out God’s name.
[Chorus 3]
	Greenfield Road got cryptids outback.
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins raid!
	Kelly Green Men!
		Alien squad at night, they invade.
	Hopkinsville Horror! Goblins attack!
	Kelly Green Men!
[Outro]
	Now the grandkids laugh when PawPaw tells it slow,
	But his hands still shake when the fireflies glow.
	The gov’ment got ‘em, that’s the word in the holler,
	But them things? They still out there... watch your collar.
