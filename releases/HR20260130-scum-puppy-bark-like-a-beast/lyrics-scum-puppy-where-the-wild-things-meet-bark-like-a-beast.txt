Scum Puppy - Where the Wild Things Meet (Bark Like a Beast)

Lyrics:
	
[Intro]
	Scum Puppy clawed his way out of the West Michigan underground like a rumor that refused to stay buried, forged in basements that shook with blown speakers and alleyway shows lit by flickering streetlamps. He didn’t arrive polished—he erupted. From rust-belt concrete and DIY chaos, he stalked the back alleys with a mic like a weapon, fusing rap’s razor wit with metal’s raw violence. His lyrics are wicked in the truest sense—twisted, clever, and unapologetically feral—spitting venom and humor in the same breath. He bends rhymes until they snarl, flipping punchlines into threats and confessionals into war cries. And then there’s the bark - not a gimmick, not a joke, but a full-throated, beastly sound that rips through tracks like a warning shot. When Scum Puppy barks, it’s the sound of something untamed breaking loose, a reminder that this superstar still prowls with dirt on his hands and hunger in his voice...
	Step right up! Step right up!
	Canvas roof, flicker bulbs, light it up!
	Don’t be shy, don’t be slow—lean in close, feel the heat,
	Human megaphone howlin’—watch me Bark like a beast!
[Verse 1]
	Born under tents where the sawdust stays,
	Grease in the air, ozone haze.
	Crooked midway, sunset bleed,
	Voice cut sharp like a rusted reed.
	See what you’ve never seen, hear what you can’t unhear,
	Hook a crowd with fear, turn confusion to cheer.
	Pitch to a rhythm, chant to a flow,
	If they stop and stare, you already know.
[Chorus]
	Step right up—don’t blink, don’t sleep,
	From the barker’s throat to the mic—Bark like a beast!
	Laugh, lunge, leer from the shadowed streets,
	No refunds, no nets—Bark like a beast!
[Verse 2]
	But wait—there’s more, I roam tent to tent,
	Bands so strange they get announced again.
	Hideous Piglet—rails get shook,
	Creature break loose, take a hard look.
	Bikini Farts flash, fizz in a snap,
	Blink and it’s gone but it sticks like a slap.
	Crisis Actors crash, drama collide,
	Bumper cars screamin’—nowhere to hide.
[Chorus]
	Step right up—don’t blink, don’t sleep,
	From the barker’s throat to the mic—Bark like a beast!
	Rattle the cages, tear the seams,
	Lean in closer—Bark like a beast!
[Verse 3]
	Sabazios Pizza, hot and loud,
	Mess on a plate tossed straight to the crowd.
	Every tent taught how far to bend,
	Push that sound ‘til it snaps again.
	Now hurry, hurry—main attraction zone,
	Solo at the mic, I’m the act, I’m the show.
	Pitch is the performance, promise none, deliver all,
	Pull the lever, press play—hear the laughter crawl.
[Bridge]
	Night of the Giving Head—sideshow spin,
	Pull My Finger—let the chaos in.
	No explanations, just teeth and grin,
	Sound that stalks you under your skin.
[Chorus]
	Step right up—don’t blink, don’t sleep,
	From the barker’s throat to the mic—Bark like a beast!
	Hear it three tents away when I speak,
	Crowd leans in—Bark like a beast!
[Verse 4]
	Don’t wander off, word on the way,
	Bigger, louder, stranger—today’s the day.
	New recordings, triple exclaim,
	Glow-in-the-dark legends call my name.
	Songs that bark back, bite when you stare,
	Only here, only now—dare if you dare.
[Outro]
	Show still rollin’, next act near,
	Step right up—hold your breath, grab your fear.
	Under canvas skies where the wild things meet,
	I howl at the crowd—Bark like a beast!
