Sandra Hook and the Crisis Actors - Krampusnacht (Sack of Writhing Children Mix)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Cloven hooves on frozen stone,
	Twisted horns and flesh of bone,
	Chains drag slow through blood-soaked snow,
	The sinner's wail—his final throes! 
	Claws like rusted iron, hooves that crack the ice,
	Horns that pierce the moonlight, blackened sacri-fice!
	Bells of dread are chiming, echoes through the pines,
	Naughty little sinners—now your flesh is mine!
[Pre Chorus]
	Santa’s twisted shadow, birch rods sting like fire,
	Chains drag through the snowfall, dragging you to Hell’s pyre!
[Chorus]
	KRAMPUS BLITZKRIEG!
	Teeth like broken sermons, eyes of burning coal!
	KRAMPUS BLITZKRIEG!
	Screams are lost in blizzard, feast upon your soul!
[Verse 2]
	Sack of bones, the wicked weep,
	Naughty souls he'll drag to deep.
	Birch rods lash, the sinners bleed,
	Darkness feeds on damned misdeed.
	Yule tide feast now turns to dread,
	Santa’s shadow—hungry, red.
	Bells toll doom in hollow chime,
	Krampus claims his feast—your spine!
[Bridge]
	Hear the whip’s crescendo—
	FLAY THEIR HIDES TO SHREDS!
	Yuletide butcher’s anthem—
	DEAD BEFORE DAWN!
[Verse 3]
	Sack of writhing children, damned to claw and plead,
	Bleeding in the ashes where the wicked feed!
	Fangs drip with repentance, tongues lick frozen tears,
	Christmas turns to nightmare—Eve of primal fear!
	Blackened sack of broken spines,
	Dragged to hell in iron binds,
	Bells of dread, the night is cursed,
	Your last breath—his hunger nursed!
[Chorus]
	KRAMPUS BLITZKRIEG!
	Maw of endless hunger, ripping through the veil!
	KRAMPUS BLITZKRIEG!
	No saint hears your prayers—ONLY HELL’S HAIL!
[Outro]
	Bells fade… snow turns red…
	Silent night…
	DEAD.
