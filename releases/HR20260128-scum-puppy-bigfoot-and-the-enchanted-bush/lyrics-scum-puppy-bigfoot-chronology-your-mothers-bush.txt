Scum Puppy - Bigfoot Chronology (Your Mother's Bush)

Lyrics:

	In a quiet town, deep in the woods, there’s a story whispered among the locals. It’s about Bigfoot, the giant creature known for its elusive nature. But this tale isn’t about the mountain paths or dark forests. No, it takes a strange turn.

	One summer evening, Bigfoot wandered away from his usual haunts, curious about a scent he had never encountered. It led him through the thick trees, past the rushing river, until he found himself at the edge of a clearing. There, he saw something that left him puzzled—a huge bush, larger than any he had seen before. It was unlike the others, with wild, tangled vines and leaves that seemed to shimmer in the fading light.

	As Bigfoot approached, he felt a strange pull. The bush was oddly inviting, almost alive. He stood before it, scratching his head, unsure of what to make of it. The bush was between your mother’s legs, and it seemed to have a life of its own. It rustled softly, beckoning him closer.

	The townsfolk say that this bush held secrets. They spoke of whispers in the night, murmurs that floated through the air like a soft breeze. Some claimed the bush was a portal, a gateway to another realm. Others believed it was a guardian, protecting something sacred. Bigfoot, however, didn’t know any of this. He was just fascinated by its size.

	Every night, he returned, drawn by an urge he couldn't explain. He watched from the shadows, observing the bush sway and dance under the moonlight. But as he got closer, he felt a chill. It was as if the bush was aware of him, studying him back.

	One night, as the moon hung high, Bigfoot gathered the courage to touch the bush. His large hand brushed against the leaves, and suddenly, the atmosphere shifted. A low growl echoed, and the bush trembled. Fear surged through him. What had he awakened?

	Then, in an instant, the growl turned into laughter. Not a friendly laugh—more like a haunting echo that sent shivers down Bigfoot's spine. The bushes began to move, twisting and curling, and for a moment, Bigfoot saw faces forming in the foliage. They were watching him, eyes gleaming with mischief.

	Then, everything changed. The ground beneath him trembled, and the bush erupted in a flurry of movement. Vines shot out, snaking toward him, wrapping around his legs like a serpent. Panic surged through him. He fought against the grip, but the more he struggled, the tighter they became. The laughter returned, echoing in the trees, blending with the rustling leaves. What had started as fascination spiraled into a nightmare. The bush was not just a guardian; it was a predator, hungry for something more than just a curious giant.

	Just as he felt the last shreds of hope slip away, something unexpected happened. The laughter morphed into a whisper, softer now, more inviting. “Join us, Bigfoot. You are not alone.” The words resonated in his soul. A flicker of understanding ignited within him. Perhaps this was not about fear or danger. Maybe it was about acceptance, a place where he could finally belong. But at what cost? The choice loomed before him, dark and alluring.

	In that moment of hesitation, he made his decision. With a final surge of strength, Bigfoot broke free from the vines and ran, deeper into the woods. The laughter faded behind him, replaced by an eerie silence. He escaped, but he could never escape the knowledge that something awaited him in the shadows. The bush still stood, a sentinel of mysteries. And as he disappeared into the darkness, the laughter echoed once more, a reminder that the woods held secrets far deeper than he could ever imagine.

	Panicking, Bigfoot stepped back. He realized he had stumbled into something he could not understand. The laughter grew louder, and the faces faded into the night. Bigfoot fled, never to return to that clearing.

	To this day, the townsfolk tell the tale of the enormous bush and the giant who dared to explore it. They warn children to stay away from that part of the woods. They say the bush still stands, waiting for its next curious creature. And if you listen closely, you might hear the laughter echoing through the trees, reminding everyone that some mysteries are better left alone.
