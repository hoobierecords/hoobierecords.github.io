Scum Puppy - I Swear I Found Religion (In That Ghost-filled Gloryhole)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Yo, Hoobie Records is in the house Ya'll
	Hoobie Records is rockin' your granny like The Carpetbagger rocks a pith helmet.
	Pull my finger... lose your lunch.
	Now sit back and let me tell you a tale...
[Verse 1]
	Down on Fifth by the broken tracks,
	Neon buzzing like a sinner’s prayer,
	There’s a boarded-up sign that just says “FILMS,”
	And a smell of regret in the air.
	They call it *The Hole*, don’t ask me why,
	Where the lonely go to disappear,
	I was broke, half-drunk, chasing a feeling,
	When I slid into a seat back there.
[Verse 2]
	They call me Scum Puppy, I earned that name,
	From loving what I shouldn’t love,
	I been digging through the gutter for a spark of heat,
	Instead of looking up above.
	Screen was shaking, shadows breathing,
	Cold crept up my spine like a lie,
	That’s when the wall started whispering,
	And I swear I saw the other side.
[Chorus]
	Oh Lord, there’s a ghost in the glory hole,
	Silk-smooth voice in the dark,
	Laughing at a broken man just looking for a spark.
	I don’t know if I was blessed or cursed,
	But I lost a piece of my soul,
	The night I met temptation
	In a ghost-filled glory hole.
[Verse 3]
	Smoke and shimmer, pale blue glow,
	Like moonlight learning how to sin,
	Said, “Hey there, big boy,” soft and slow,
	And I leaned where I shouldn’t have been.
	Touch like thunder, laugh like sin,
	Half joke, half holy crime,
	I was dancing with something dead and dangerous,
	Feeling more alive than I’d felt in time.
[Chorus]
	Yeah, there’s a ghost in the glory hole,
	Playing tricks on my mind,
	Turning shame into laughter,
	Leaving reason behind.
	I couldn’t tell if it was heaven
	Or a joke I shouldn’t have told,
	But I swear I found religion
	In that ghost-filled glory hole.
[Bridge]
	Then the walls started melting,
	Carnival of the damned,
	Laughing shadows, moaning echoes,
	Reaching out like I was the plan.
	“Join us,” they sang in harmony,
	Every fear and thrill combined,
	I was one bad second from forever,
	Leaving my old life behind.
[Verse 4]
	Crash of thunder, lights came back,
	Just popcorn, dust, and chairs,
	No ghosts, no glow, no laughing walls,
	Just me and my thousand stares.
	I stumbled out into the streetlight,
	Heart pounding like a drum,
	Told myself it was just a dream,
	But I knew I’d be back again.
[Chorus]
	‘Cause there’s a ghost in the glory hole,
	And she knows my name,
	Turns my shame into a punchline,
	Sets my nerves aflame.
	They can whisper all they want to,
	Say I’ve finally lost control,
	But legends gotta start somewhere,
	Like a ghost-filled glory hole.
[Outro]
	Now the locals tell the story low,
	With a laugh and a warning tone,
	About a man, a ghost, and a broken screen,
	Where the lonely ain’t alone.
	If you go looking for a cheap thrill,
	You might find more than you know.
	Some sins don’t die…
	They just learn how to glow.
