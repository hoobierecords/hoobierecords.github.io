Jimson Sirkus - Crotch Rockin’ (Michigan Squatchin')

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Yo, fool… The woods of West Michigan close in on Jimson Sirkus like a damp, breathing thing. Beneath the low sky and constant drizzle, the pines stand crooked and watchful, their needles whispering secrets older than the towns rotting at their edges. Every step sinks into black loam and dead leaves, each footfall sounding too loud, too deliberate. Somewhere beyond the tree line, something answers—wood on wood, a hollow knock that echoes through the fog like a warning. Jimson doesn’t flinch. They came here for the thing the locals refuse to name, the shadow that drags across back roads and presses its face against cabin windows in the dead of night.
	By midnight, the knocking surrounds them, circling, patient. The Sasquatch never shows itself fully—only glimpses - a massive silhouette between trunks, eyes catching light like dying embers, the sound of something huge pacing just out of sight. Jimson feels the forest leaning inward, as if the land itself wants them gone. This is no simple beast; this is an ancient thing, bound to these woods, feeding on isolation and dread. And as the darkness deepens, it becomes unclear who is stalking whom—because in West Michigan, the forest always collects its due.
[Verse]
	Step right up, witness the grand deceit,
	Hoobie kings with nasty, mystery meat.
	Chumming the water with rancid bait.
	Sirkus freaks gather at the Jimson gate.
	Hoobie Records champs with a sleight of hand,
	Insane prophets in the Jimson promised land.
[Pre-Chorus] 
	Hobos gather for the Sirkus feast,
	Gobblin’ on the Lake Worth Beast.
	Smoke and mirrors, a carnival con,
	Like a genie in a lamp appears shaitan.
[Chorus]
	 Step right up to the madness, Jimson Sirkus! 	 Crotch Rockin’!
	 Hear the woods go wild when the beat start lurkin’! 	 Squatch gawkin’!
	 From the deep back forest to the front row moshin’! 	 Tree knockin’!
	 Whole crowd loud when the freak show talkin’! 	 Chicken squawkin’!
[Verse] 
	Step up, step up, the show’s gonna start,
	Whoever smelt it, dealt it, like performance fart.
	Rubber chicken dance, now drop your drawers, 
	Keep your dinger hidden, it’s infested with sores.
	Side-show siren sings a predatory tune,
	Scum Puppy replies with a bark at the poon.
[Pre-Chorus]
	Hobos gather for the Sirkus feast,
	Gobblin’ on the Lake Worth Beast.
	Smoke and mirrors, a carnival con,
	Like a genie in a lamp appears shaitan.
[Chorus]
	 Jimson crew gonna make ya drop your drawers!
	 Drawers!
	 Corrupted Sirkus antics from Holland to Bangor!
	 Bangor!
	 Jimson rockin’ your granny like a Michigan Squatch!
	 Squatch!
	 Hideous, deviant Sirkus freaks hittin’ tha hairy crotch!
	 Crotch!
[Bridge]
	Oh-oh The tent’s on fire but the clowns don’t care,
	Oh-oh Stackin’ the cards while you’re stuck in the air.
	Our erotic rhymes will make your cooter quake!
	Ask your mama, she embraced this one-eyed snake!
	Oh-oh Pyramid crumbles, but the laughter remains,
	Oh-oh Circus keeps rollin’ down bankrupt lanes.
[Chorus]
	Step right up to the madness, Jimson Sirkus! 	Crotch Rockin’!
	Hear the woods go wild when the beat start lurkin’! 	Squatch gawkin’!
	From the deep back forest to the front row moshin’! 	Tree knockin’!
	Whole crowd loud when the freak show talkin’! 	Chicken squawkin’!
[Outro]
	Bow to the Jimson jokers, the kings of the con,
	Vanished like smoke by the butt crack of dawn.
	Left you a ticket and a hole in your hand—
	Welcome, sucka… to the promised Sirkus land.
