Scum Puppy - Exalted Order of Goats (Hazelbank)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Buried in ash where the furnaces roared,
	Steel jaws yawned—but the goats ignored.
	Their horns gleamed black with furnace soot,
	Pact signed in blood, infernal root.
[Verse 1]
	Holland’s maw devoured the weak,
	Yet the herd marched—hooves split the street.
	Exalted, crowned in molten gold,
	Their bleats tore the sky, unholy and cold.
	Black hooves stamp on Holland’s pyre,
	Furnace jaws yawn—flame rewrite the choir!
	Molten hymns bleed through the grate,
	The Exalted Order opens the gate.
[Pre-Chorus]
	The Order kneels in sulfur light,
	Hooves scrape the altar’s blight!
	Feed the forge!
	Ash and bone in sacred fire,
	Praise the Goat!
	Twisted spire—your funeral pyre!
[Chorus]
	Feed the forge!
	Ash and bone in sacred fire,
	Praise the Goat!
	Twisted spire—your funeral pyre!
	Scorched hooves!
	Hazelbank burns where they tread!
	Exalted!
	The furnace feeds on the dead!
[Verse 2]
	Flames licked hymns in a goat-tongued chant,
	Piston hearts beat—steel-spined and gaunt.
	Smoke-choked lungs, eyes like coal,
	Their god was the blast, their sacrament—souls.
	Skin peels back in furnace light,
	Eyes aglow with sulfur dread,
	Holland’s jaws devour the night,
	Slaves to the goat are dead!
[Pre-Chorus]
	The Order kneels in sulfur light,
	Hooves scrape the altar’s blight!
	Feed the forge!
	Ash and bone in sacred fire,
	Praise the Goat!
	Twisted spire—your funeral pyre!
[Chorus]
	Feed the forge!
	Ash and bone in sacred fire,
	Praise the Goat!
	Twisted spire—your funeral pyre!
	Scorched hooves!
	Hazelbank burns where they tread!
	Exalted!
	The furnace feeds on the dead!
[Bridge]
	By decree of horn and brand,
	Ash reclaims the promised land.
	The order stands… where the last ember dies,
	Horns pierce the veil… through the smoke-choked skies.
	Tongues of flame lick the sky,
	Horns ascend—you will die!
	No redemption, only pain,
	Hazelbank’s infernal reign!
[Outro]
	No mourners left—just the clank of chains,
	Hazelbank gleams… in the goats’ domain.
	Ash-wombs birth the horned decree—
	YOUR NAME IS FIRE!, YOU DIE WITH ME!
