Scum Puppy - Rush Call (Backyard Bob)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Yo, Hoobie Records is in tha' house, ya'll!
	Hoobie! Idiot! Hoobie! Idiot! 
	Hoobie Records is gonna rock you so fast, it will make your head spin!
	Hoobie! Idiot! Hoobie! Idiot! 
	"What's that land mass called over there? ... A Stick Out.
	Bang Bang Shrimp! Bang Bang Shrimp!
	Look at that crema!
[Verse 1]
	Like a pimp in his golf cart, creepin' in Mesa fog,
	A couple stingers on board, gotta avoid the law dog!
	Top off Bob's glass... hit him with a jigger,
	Careful with that drink... don't take a Digger!
	Bob remodels like a P-R-O, it's sick,
	And when he rewires, you better grab the Stick!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	This Chef Tell fool is gonna hit you with the shocker!
[Verse 2]
	Bobby's vineyard is blown' up with grapes,
	Hegbloom winery is rockin' the Great Lakes!
	And Bob's no alky, Bob's no drunk,
	And Bridgette's got junk in the trunk!
	Bob's Jura espresso has crema so foamy,
	Mad trumpet skills like Chuck Mangione!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	This Chef Tell fool is gonna hit you with the shocker!
[Bridge]
	Glup, Glup... Glup, Glup music to his ears,
	Mamacita... oh, Mamacita —cheers!
	Boiled crisco sounds wonderful.
	Rush call! Rush call! Make room for Juju!
	Oh! It's a Blowout!
	Dusty! ... Dusty!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	This Chef Tell fool is gonna hit you with the shocker!
[Outro]
	Friends will come,
	and friends will go,
	Friends will peter,
	Out you know,
	Peter out,
	or Peter in,
	we'll be friends,
	through thick and thin...
	Brothers gotta hug.
