Scum Puppy - P-R-O Grillmaster (Backyard Bob)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Like a pimp in his golf cart, creepin' in Mesa fog,
	A couple toddies on board, gotta avoid the law dog!
	Top off Bob's glass... hit him with a jigger,
	Careful with that drink... don't take a Digger!
	Bob remodels like a [spell it out] P-R-O, it's so slick,
	And when he rewires, you better grab the Stick!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	Spell it out... P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	Chef Tell's food is gonna hit you like a shocker!
[Verse 2]
	Bobby's vineyard is blown' up with grapes,
	Hegbloom winery is rockin' the Great Lakes!
	But It's neither here, nor there... and whatnot.
	And Bridgette's, got junk, in the trunk!
	Bob's Jura espresso has crema so foamy,
	Mad trumpet skills like chuck Mangione!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	Chef Tell's food is gonna hit you like a shocker!
[Bridge]
	Glurp, Glurp... Glurp, Glurp... music to his ears,
	Mamacita... oh, Mamacita —cheers!
	Boiled crisco sounds wonderful,
	Rush call! Rush call! Make room for Juju!
	Oh! It's a Blowout!
	Dusty! ... Dusty!
[Chorus]
	Built Ram tough, They call him Backyard Bob,
	[spell it out] P-R-O grill master with a wicked kebab!
	With a toddy in his left hand, a toddy in the right,
	Lighting up the green egg, watch the flames ignite!
	Bob's a Ferris bulldog and a bar-tending viking rocker,
	Chef Tell's food is gonna hit you like a shocker!
[Outro]
	Friends will come,
	and friends will go,
	Friends will peter,
	Out you know,
	Peter out,
	or Peter in,
	we'll be friends,
	through thick and thin...
	"Brothers gotta hug"
