Kook Maluke - Rubber Gloves in My Jaws

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Tiny body, big rage, couch king, sock sage, rubber gloves in my jaws,
	Mailman route patrol, walkin’ to the mailbox, eye twitchin’ at the gate,
	Dog park demon, chase the ball ballistic, skrrt on the grass, no brakes,
	Pizza crust dreams, cookie crumbs on my face, beggin’ with the stare,
	Commands rain down—“sit!”, “lay down!”, “spin!”, “up!”, “roll over!”, “bang! play dead!",
	Ad-libs everywhere, tail helicopterin’, who let the York loose?

[Chorus]
	Who barfed up this Puke? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who likes chicken and Beef? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Who dat furry spook? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who’s huggies are too brief? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Circle pit paws up, tiny terror stomp!
	Call it, crowd! Who? —Kook Maluke!

[Verse 2]
	Potty on the bed, lookin’ guilty-cute, blame the cat,
	TV talkin’ slick, news anchor catch these teeth,
	Zoomies at night, hallway NASCAR, sofa off the ropes,
	Frogger in my mouth, piggy scream choir, I conduct the noise,
	“Drop it for a trade”, “Who wants a hot dog?”, sit pretty,
	Ad-libs floodin’, Yorkie thunder clap, small dog, big threat!

[Pre-Chorus]
	Muma grabs the keys, I pout on the floor,
	“Get in your bag”, goin' to the store,
	Alone in the house, time moves slow,
	Door clicks back, what up, bro?

[Chorus]
	Who barfed up this Puke? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who likes chicken and Beef? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Who dat furry spook? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who’s huggies are too brief? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Wall of sound—paws slam, pit goes feral,
	Yorkie chant it! Sock! Thief! Sock! Thief!

[Bridge]
	“Who wants to night night in the bed?”, curl up tight,
	“Who want’s do go bub-bye in the car?”, tongue out flight,
	“Want to go for a walk walk walk?”, leash clink riot,
	Tiny titan strut, Yorkie reigns supreme!

[Chorus]
	Who barfed up this Puke? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who likes chicken and Beef? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Who dat furry spook? Gotta be Kook Maluke!
	Who’s huggies are too brief? Gotta be tha Sock Thief!
	Say it louder! Who? —Sock Thief!
	Circle pit of paws, fur in the air,
	Final bark count —One! Two! Three!

[Outro]
	Tiny king exits stage, socks gone, gloves gone,
	Kook Maluke out —Yorkie mic drop.
