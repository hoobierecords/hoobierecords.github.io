Scum Puppy - Who Love it Nasty?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Scum Puppy loud, I chew the screen like bubblegum.
	Rubber monsters wobble, budget zero, my brain is numb!
	Chainsaw noise go *brrr* but it’s clearly a kazoo.
	Creature appears at night like The Great Gazoo!
	Popcorn flyin’, grindhouse grime on my sleeve.
	Fake blood lookin’ like ketchup, still I scream!
	I don’t need realism, give me chaos instead.
	Cardboard sets and bad wigs mess with my head!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Lights go out, crowd growls, speakers start wheezin’.
	Scum Puppy foamin’ at the mouth for no reason!
[Chorus]
	Who run the grindhouse?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Who love it nasty?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Too loud, too fake?!
	We love that junk!
	So bad it’s good?!
	Turn it up, punk!
[Verse 2]
	Monster suit zipper showin’, I still clap.
	Boom mic in the shot, that’s a cinematic trap!
	Dubbed voices off-sync, lips runnin’ late.
	Hero flex too long, now it’s clearly fate!
	Sirens, neon titles, fonts scream loud.
	Every line yelled like it’s mad at the crowd!
	I don’t want polish, give me dirt and glue.
	Scum Puppy raised on flicks nobody knew!
	[Pre-Chorus]
	Reel snaps, tape melts, smoke in the row
	Scum Puppy moshing while the credits still roll
[Chorus]
	Who run the grindhouse?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Who love it nasty?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Too loud, too fake?!
	We love that junk!
	So bad it’s good?!
	Turn it up, punk!
[Bridge]
	I don’t fear monsters, I fear big budgets.
	Give me foam latex and bad fake punches.
	If it don’t stink, I don’t want the show.
	Scum Puppy thrive where the standards low.
[Chorus]
	Who run the grindhouse?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Who love it nasty?!
	Scum Puppy!
	Too loud, too fake?!
	We love that junk!
	So bad it’s good?!
	Turn it up, punk!
[Outro]
	Pull My Finger! Lose Your Lunch! 
	Scum Puppy!
	Pull My Finger! Lose Your Lunch! 
	Scum Puppy!
	Pull My Finger! Lose Your Lunch! 
	Scum Puppy!
	Pull My Finger! Lose Your Lunch! 
	Scum Puppy!
