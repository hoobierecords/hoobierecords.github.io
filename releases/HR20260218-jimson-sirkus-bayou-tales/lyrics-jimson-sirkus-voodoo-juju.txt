Jimson Sirkus - Voodoo Juju 

Lyrics:

[Verse]
	Midnight,Bigfoot, man-meat, display!
	Chupacabra, fart-rock, ballet!
	Demon, Howler, vicious, lobster!
	Mothman, Hodag, dapper, mobster!
	Skunk Ape, Devil, pig-face, crossbreed!
	Howler, Booger, ghost-war, decreed!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Skookum, Dartmoor, Ozark Beast!
	Pope Lick, Mogollon, Scape Ore feast!
	Montauk, Loch Ness, Dover, weeps!
	Flatwoods, Lake Worth, Loveland, creeps!
[Chorus]
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Zombi curses with coffin nails!
	Shadows creep from between the trees!
	Unnamed ancients rise from the sea!
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Summon spirits beyond the pale!
	Hoobie witches conjure forbidden names!
	The Jimson Sirkus goes up in flames!
[Verse]
	Yowie, Yeti, Dogman, bile!
	Sasquatch, Frogman, Wall Street, guile!
	Almas, Wolfman, ancient, lore!
	Grassman, Boo Hag, putrid, gore!
	Goatman, Rougarou, circus, games!
	Wampus, Wildman, deadly, flames!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Skookum, Dartmoor, Ozark Beast!
	Pope Lick, Mogollon, Scape Ore feast!
	Montauk, Loch Ness, Dover, weeps!
	Flatwoods, Lake Worth, Loveland, creeps!
[Chorus]
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Zombi curses with coffin nails!
	Shadows creep from between the trees!
	Unnamed ancients rise from the sea!
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Summon spirits beyond the pale!
	Hoobie witches conjure forbidden names!
	The Jimson Sirkus goes up in flames!
[Bridge]
	Candle flame bend sideways when I speak that tone.
	Shadows pile up like debts you never outgrown.
	Psalms rot in the mouth, get spat back reversed.
	Even hell pause a second, ask who spoke first.
	Spirits roam the back roads, knock sleep out your eyes.
	Demons count favors while they sharpen the lies.
	What you buried in silence just learned how to walk.
	Night sign the contract—dawn only chalk.
[Chorus]
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Zombi curses with coffin nails!
	Shadows creep from between the trees!
	Unamed ancients rise from the sea!
	Voodoo juju from bayou tales!
	Summon spirits beyond the pale!
	Hoobie witches conjure forbidden names!
	The Jimson Sirkus goes up in flames!
