Lyrics:

[Verse]
	I don't need no help from a friend,
	All I need is an aces hand!
	Aces, it's a metal jamboree,
	Aces, oh can't you see!
[Pre Chorus]
	No, two, three, four, yeah!
	I want aces.
	I want aces!
	I want aces, now!
[Chorus]
	Aces,
	Aces,
	Aces, I want aces.
	No, two, three, four, yeah!
	I want aces,
	I want aces, Now!
[Verse]
	Straight, flush, or four of a kind,
	Give me aces before I go blind!
	Aces, it's a metal jamboree,
	Aces, oh can't you see!
[Pre Chorus]
	No, two, three, four, yeah!
	I want aces,
	I want aces,
	I want aces, now!
[Chorus]
	Aces,
	Aces,
	Aces, I want aces.
	No, two, three, four -yeah!
	I want Aces,
	I want aces, Now!
[Chorus]
	Aces,
	Aces,
	Aces, I want aces,
	No, two, three, four, yeah!
	I want aces,
	Aces,
	Aces,
	Aces, I want aces.
	No, two, three, four, yeah!
	I want aces,
	I want aces, Now!
