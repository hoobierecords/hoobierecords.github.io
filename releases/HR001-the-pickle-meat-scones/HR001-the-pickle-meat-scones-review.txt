The Pickle - Meat Scones (Review)

z11v11 Feb 20, 2009

First off this cd-r release is unadulterated, juvenile, gonzo humor. With that being stated let's discuss the release. The opening track, "Meat Scones [Part1]," catches The Pickle narrating a story (while driving his car) in which he was to purchase some scones. This in itself is not exceptionally, but it is when you hear hear him cursing at other drivers that the pure comedy begins. In the 2nd track, "Injuring Illegals [Part1]," and 6th track, "Injuring Illegals [Part2]," The Pickle weighs the value of human life and makes (il)logical comparisons to road kill. The 4th track, "Cow Toilet Paper," is a classic... total ingenuity! The cd-r continues with many more tracks of bizarre laughing, bad jokes, and weird situations. Highly recommended for those who enjoy nonsensical, whacked-out humor.
