Jimson Sirkus - Gob On My Dinger (Live Wire)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Welcome, deviants and daring curiosities. Tonight the tent is sealed, the sawdust is slick, and the calliope hums low with promise. You didn’t come to watch—you came to partake, so step into the ring where grease gleams like stage lights. Shed the daylight rules at the flap of the tent; here, the circus thrives on insanity—bold and raw.
	So oil up, strut out, and play your part - strongmen, contortionists, lion tamers, bearded ladies, knife-throwers, and all you clowns. Keep your mouths moist, your eyes open, and your minds open.. Let the tent roar and the Jimson Sirkus spectacle begin!
[Verse]
	Circus lights on the Hoobie brigade,  
	Sideshow kings in a masquerade!
	Twisted schemes with a carnival twist,  
	Corn dodgers pushin’ with a greasy fist!
	The ringmaster’s laugh from a Sirkus clown,
	Tossin’ off oddities—like a beat down!
	Freaks stack high in a greasy climb,  
	Projectile chimps—at the scene of the crime!
[Chorus]
	Step right up, take a gob on my dinger,
	Open wide like a ratty, Craigslist swinger!
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
	Mutant oddity kings ensconced on a greasy throne,  
	Circus deviants with a mic and red, raw dog bones!
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
[Verse]
	My tent’s too tight and it’s hard to grind,  
	Shell game hands keep ‘em deaf, dumb, and blind!
	Midway hustlers with a stink, wink and nod,  
	Jimson Sirkus is rockin’ with the Hoobie squad!
	The high wire’s strung with the devil’s thread,  
	Jimson Sirkus freak bangers got you all misled!
	Freakshow carnys panting in the dark,  
	Smell is as foul as Scum Puppy’s bark!
[Chorus]
	Drop your drawers in this carnal parade,
	Watch your step near the shocker brigade.	
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
	Unknown legends master the carnival game,
	Step right up, don’t be shy—ignite the flame!
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
[Bridge]
	Under the big top lights, Bigfoot stompin’ the ring,
	Sawdust in his fur, crowd hush when the bass drum sing.
	Lion tamer froze up, clown paint start to drip,
	’Cause a myth with a mic make the tightrope flip.
	Elephant trunks swing when he bang on the cage,
	From folklore to folklore, he’s headlinin’ rage.
	Popcorn hit the floor when the monster spit truth,
	Hardcore legend wildin’ out—circus can’t tame Sasquatch youth.	
[Chorus]
	Step right up, take a gob on my dinger,
	Open wide like a ratty, Craigslist swinger!
	Drop your drawers in this carnal parade,
	Watch your step near the shocker brigade!
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
	Mutant oddity kings ensconced on a greasy throne,  
	Circus deviants with a mic and red, raw dog bones!
	Unknown legends master the carnival game,
	Step right up, don’t be shy—ignite the flame!
	This freak tent is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
	Jimson Sirkus live wire! Wire! Wire! Wire!
