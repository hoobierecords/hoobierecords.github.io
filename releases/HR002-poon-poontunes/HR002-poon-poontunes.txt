Description:
Poontunes by Poon feels like a joyful, slightly unhinged playground where humor and heart coexist. The album leans into its irreverent title, serving up tracks that don’t take themselves too seriously while still showing a clear sense of craft and intention. There’s a lo-fi, DIY charm running through the songs, with melodies that feel spontaneous and goofy on the surface but surprisingly sticky once they land. It’s the kind of record that invites you to laugh first, then realize you’re genuinely vibing.

Underneath the silliness, Poontunes has a weirdly earnest soul. Poon uses absurdity as a delivery system for personality, turning off-kilter sounds and playful structures into something cohesive and memorable. The album thrives on its refusal to be polished or predictable, instead embracing quirks, rough edges, and moments that feel delightfully unfiltered. By the end, Poontunes leaves the impression that fun itself is the point—and that’s exactly why it works.

Genre: Mock-Rock, Alternative
