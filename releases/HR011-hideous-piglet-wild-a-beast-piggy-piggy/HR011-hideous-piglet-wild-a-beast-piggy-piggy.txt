Description:
Piggy, Piggy by Hideous Piglet Wild-a-Beast is a snarling, lo-fi time capsule that captures the band’s raw early-’90s chaos in one compact, absurdist package. Blending abrasive garage punk with prank-call theatrics and deliberately unpolished production, the album feels less like a traditional release and more like a deranged pirate radio broadcast hijacked by two unhinged farm punks. Overlord’s slashing guitar and feral vocals collide with Scum Puppy’s relentless drumming, creating a noisy backbone for the band’s twisted humor and confrontational energy. The title track—presented in both its original studio form and a brief, feedback-drenched live cut—serves as the album’s squealing manifesto.

Much of the record centers around the chaotic “Cowkickers Radio Show Promo 1991” segments, stitched together from interview fragments, musical bursts, and off-the-wall bits like “Watch and Learn” and “My Brother Was a Pumpkin.” Queen Been’s appearances as interviewer and prank caller add a layer of anarchic performance art, blurring the line between music and skit. Originally scattered across multiple Dead Dog Records releases from 1990 and 1991, these tracks are compiled here into a fast, abrasive collage that showcases Hideous Piglet Wild-a-Beast at their most irreverent and unfiltered—equal parts noise act, satire troupe, and underground punk spectacle.
