Description:
Stretched Beyond All Recognition by Jeremy’s Hot Pocket is a blisteringly fast, unapologetically outrageous EP that leans hard into shock humor and breakneck energy. Across six tightly packed tracks—most barely cracking the one-minute mark—the band delivers a chaotic burst of raw instrumentation and tongue-in-cheek provocation. Titles like “Peaked For Penitration,” “Tossing Off,” and “The Cock Ring” signal the group’s irreverent, no-holds-barred approach, blending juvenile wordplay with an almost grindcore sense of urgency.

Despite its brief runtime, the album feels intentionally unfiltered and confrontational, pairing frantic riffs with abrupt endings that leave little room to breathe. Tracks such as “Showers And Growers” and the comparatively sprawling “Pelvic Pocket Pliers” round out the project with the same abrasive humor and relentless pacing. The result is a compact, high-intensity release that thrives on pushing buttons, delivering shock value as both its aesthetic and its punchline.
