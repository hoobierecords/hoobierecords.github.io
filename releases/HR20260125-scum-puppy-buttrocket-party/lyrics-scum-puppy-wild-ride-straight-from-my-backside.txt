Scum Puppy - Wild Ride (Straight From My Backside)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Woke up this morning, feeling kinda bold,
	Thought I'd launch a rocket, 'cause the weather's cold.
	Grabbed a bottle, filled it up with dreams,
	Tiny explosions, bursting at the seams.
[Chorus]
	Light it up, let it fly, straight from my backside,
	Punk rock spirit in this wild ride.
	Counting down from three, and then I let it go,
	Who needs a launchpad when you’ve got this show?
[Verse 2]
	Neighbors all staring, think I’ve lost my mind,
	But who needs a filter when you’re one of a kind?
	Taking off like fireworks, watch the sparks ignite,
	It’s a butt rocket party, feeling oh-so-right!
[Chorus]
	Light it up, let it fly, straight from my backside,
	Punk rock spirit in this wild ride.
	Counting down from three, and then I let it go,
	Who needs a launchpad when you’ve got this show?
[Bridge]
	Got my DIY degree in backyard science,
	Fueling up with laughter, chaos, and defiance.
	So join the crew, we’re blasting through the air,
	With every little pop, we’re shaking up despair.
[Chorus]
	Light it up, let it fly, straight from my backside,
	Punk rock spirit in this wild ride.
	Counting down from three, and then I let it go,
	Who needs a launchpad when you’ve got this show?
[Outro]
	So here’s to the dreamers with rockets in their hearts,
	Launching from the bottom, we’re masters of the arts.
	Raise a bottle high, let’s ignite the night,
	With a punk rock laugh, we’ll take our flight!
