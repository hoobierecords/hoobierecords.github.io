Scum Puppy - Boo Hag (Mad Libs)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Yo! Ayo—uh, yeah! Scum Puppy stomps the tent floor, dark carnival breathing loudly tonight.
	Check it, check it, Yoink! Uh-oh-yeah! Ayo… wait, what? lights flicker, drums hesitate.
	Yeah! Y’all already know! Yerp! Skippity-yeah! clowns arguing backstage, confidence wobbling proudly.
	Yo! Yo! Yo! Scum Puppy in the shadows, Yoink! Uh-oh-yeah! teeth clacking rhythmically.
	Ayo—uh, yeah! Check it, check it, Boom-bap-oops! Beat drop—careful! knuckles crack.
	Y’all already know! Dark tent breathing, Fire! Marshmallow level, smoke crawling low.
[Verse 1]
	Uh, listen up, yeah, I’m back again, Scum Puppy snarls softly, Boom-bap-oops! echoes sideways.
	Word up, real talk, let it happen then, Okay-but-why-though? crowd squints, nods, shrugs together.
	Mic check—still checking! Rhythm? I hardly know ’em! drums arguing with my heartbeat.
	Bars… granola kind! Bars so clean—squeaky! teeth grind, sparks fly, patience gone.
	Uh-huh, no doubt, feel me now, No doubt—some doubt! Facts-ish! For real-ish!
	Straight facts, all day, hear me loud, Big facts… tiny brain! juggling bravado, dropping sense.
	Mic check—still checking! Rhythm? I hardly know ’em! Bars… granola kind! crunchy delivery.
	Bars so clean—squeaky! Fire! Marshmallow level, legendary… locally! hype contained, mostly safe.
[Chorus]
	Yeah! Yeah! We in here—okay! Certified head nod! stomp stomp, scream Scum Puppy!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Turn it up—just a bit! Too hype—need water! Energy loading… 12%!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Uh! Uh! Say less—say nothing! All cap, no visor! crash forward together!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Straight up, nonstop, hear the crowd say—Scum Puppy! Scum Puppy! then collide!
[Verse 2]
	Uh, listen up, yeah, I’m back again, Scum Puppy pacing cages, eyes wide, snarling.
	Word up, real talk, let it happen then, Big facts… tiny brain! still plotting domination.
	Ayy, look, check it out, I’m on my way, Big move—small steps! sawdust in sneakers.
	No cap, big moves, yeah, okay, No cap—tiny beanie! All cap, no visor!
	Feel that? Believe that! Heavy vibes—light snacks! Light work… heavy breathing!
	Facts on facts, uh, say less, react, Say less—say nothing! Uh—brain buffering!
	Hold up—nah! Okay okay—one okay! Crowd say—indistinct mumbling! That’s right—probably!
	Fresh sounds—still defrosting! Let me cook—microwave! Certified bop—by my mom!
[Chorus]
	Yeah! Yeah! We in here—okay! Certified head nod! stomp stomp, scream Scum Puppy!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Turn it up—just a bit! Too hype—need water! Energy loading… 12%!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Uh! Uh! Say less—say nothing! All cap, no visor! crash forward together!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Straight up, nonstop, hear the crowd say—Scum Puppy! Scum Puppy! then collide!
[Bridge]
	Uh! Yeah! Ayo! Woo! Alright! Okay! Let’s go… slowly! Yep-ish! Woo-ish!
	Huh?! Audibly confused, ayo—wrong verse! Let’s get it… later! Real talk—cartoon voice!
	Uh! Yeah! Ayo! Woo! Yerp! Skippity-yeah! Huh?! audibly confused!
	Ayo—wrong verse! Let’s get it… later! Real talk—cartoon voice! distorted megaphone!
	Uh! Yeah! Ayo! Woo-ish! Yep-ish! Yerp! Skippity-yeah!
	Huh?! Audibly confused, Beat drop—careful! floor apologizes quietly!
[Chorus]
	Yeah! Yeah! We in here—okay! Certified head nod! stomp stomp, scream Scum Puppy!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Turn it up—just a bit! Too hype—need water! Energy loading… 12%!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Uh! Uh! Say less—say nothing! All cap, no visor! crash forward together!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Straight up, nonstop, hear the crowd say—Scum Puppy! Scum Puppy! then collide!
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Scum Puppy! Scum Puppy! sanity shouting, chaos howling, crowd chanting wrong words proudly.
	Hoobie! Hoobie! Hoobie!
	Straight up… then nap! Encore? …maybe one! Let’s get it… later!
[Outro]
	Yo! Uh-huh-maybe! All day—until lunch! Heavy vibes—light snacks! carnival closes politely.
	You already know, Scum Puppy bows crooked, Legend whispered loudly, Legendary… locally!
	Straight up… then nap! Certified bop—by my mom! applause arrives confused.
	Yeah! Say what—politely! Mic drops gently, Fire! Marshmallow level, applause achieved.
