The Semi-Flying, Headless, Screaming, Thrashing Chickens - You Went To Your Locker

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Check, Check, Choo Choo Check, Choo Choo Check.
	What up, foo... Bally is ready to clog your toilet with an insane turd!
	Bally!  Bally! Bally! Bally!  Bally! Bally! Bally!  Bally! Bally! 
	—Let’s go!
[Verse - Instrumental]
[Chorus]
	You went to class and,
	He took your jeans!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	You felt like a fool,
	In your little underwear!
	Ha, ha, haha, ha, haha!
	Doo, doo, doo!
	You went to your locker and,
	I don't know.
[Verse - Instrumental]
[Chorus]
	You went to class and,
	He took your jeans!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	You felt like a fool,
	In your little underwear!
	Ha, ha, haha, ha, haha!
	Doo, doo, doo!
	You went to your locker and,
	I don't know.
[Bridge - Instrumental]
[Chorus]
	You went to class and,
	He took your jeans!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	Doo, doo, doo, doo!
	You felt like a fool,
	In your little underwear!
	Ha, ha, haha, ha, haha!
	Doo, doo, doo!
	You went to your locker and,
	I don't know.
[Outro]
	Just a gas...
