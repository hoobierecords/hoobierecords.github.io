Scum Puppy - Annals of the Marionette Massacre

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	In a world… echo! echo! where strings don’t snap.
	Where blades don’t cut… but they never stop!
	from the drive-in of the damned... scream!
	he’s wood, he’s wired, he’s way too mad!
[Verse 1]
	Midnight marquee, neon bleed, puppet twitchin’ wooden grin with a murder mission,
	Butter knife dull, bendin’, bowin’, grindin’ every stab slow-mo, sweat-soakin’ pine skin.
	Sir Fletcher Munson Curve sip wine in lace tux pressed clean ‘til the blade hit face,
	Knife won’t pierce, gotta jab and drag sawdust tears in a body bag.
	Ad-libs echo— CUT! REWIND! —rewind, grindhouse scream with a tagline shine rewind,
	“He takes his time!”. “He won’t be kind!”
	Wooden hands steady, first corpse signed, scream!
[Chorus]
	Who stalk the streets with the strings attached?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who kill slow ‘cause the blade half-cracked?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who leave splinters in a bloodbath splatter?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
[Verse 2]
	Overlord boast, chrome throne talk (ha!) puppet creep with a stiff-leg walk,
	Butter knife kiss, don’t cut, just bruise (damn!) thirty stabs deep, still gotta push through.
	Blade bend sideways, knuckles all scarred (ow!) killin’ so hard when the tool subpar,
	Ad-libs fly— STAB! SCRAPE! Why won’t you die?! Grindhouse fate.
	Projector flicker, crowd go wild, kill scene long like a lost reel file,
	Wooden breath heave, Overlord flat— Second name carved with a buttered hack!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Hear the strings strain, hear the hinge joints cry,
	Every murder marathon, no quick goodbye.
	Blade too soft but the will stay stiff,
	Kill take forever, but the crowd don’t dip!
[Chorus]
	Who pull strings when the moon turn red?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who saw slow ‘til the victim dead?
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who earn every kill with a busted utensil?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
[Bridge]
	Final act twist, reflection crack,
	Scum Puppy stare— puppet stare back.
	Butter knife rise, irony thick,
	Creator get carved by the character flick!
[Chorus]
	Who bleed the booth in a grindhouse frame?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who kill so slow it hurt the brain?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who wood-on-flesh make the speakers rattle?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
	Who bow at the end of the splatter chapter?!
	 Marionette Massacre!
[Outro]
	Coming soon… echo fade, no strings cu
	Butter knife bent, legend still struck.
	Drive-in burn, film reel snap,
	Marionette… Marionette… Massacre!
