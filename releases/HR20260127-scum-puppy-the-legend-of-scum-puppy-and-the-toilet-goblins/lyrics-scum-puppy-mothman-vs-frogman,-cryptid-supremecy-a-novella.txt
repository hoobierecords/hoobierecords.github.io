Scum Puppy - Mothman Vs. Frogman, Cryptid Supremacy (A Novella)

Lyrics:

	On the banks of the Ohio River, shadows danced under the pale moonlight. The air was thick with tension, a chill creeping through the night. Whispers of an ancient rivalry hung like fog over the water. The Loveland Frogman, with his green, scaly skin and bulging eyes, prowled along the riverbank. He had long claimed these waters as his own.

	But tonight was different. The stillness cracked like thunder as the Point Pleasant Mothman emerged from the darkness. Tall and menacing, with wings that stretched wide, he glared down at the Frogman. Rumors had spread that a new challenger sought the title of supreme cryptid. Their eyes locked, both creatures knew what was coming.

	The Frogman croaked defiantly, his voice echoing against the river. “This is my territory. You don’t belong here!” He felt the weight of his ancestors behind him. For years, he had ruled these banks, scaring off fishermen and curious children alike. The stories of his slimy figure were known far and wide.

	The Mothman flapped his wings, sending a gust of wind that ruffled the reeds. “You think you can intimidate me with your croaks? I bring darkness and prophecy! The world will remember my name!” He was the harbinger of doom, a creature of nightmares. People spoke of him in hushed tones, fearful of the warnings he brought...

	As the moon climbed higher, the battle began. The Frogman lunged forward, his strong legs propelling him through the air. The Mothman countered, swooping down with razor-sharp talons. Each clash sent ripples through the water, stirring the silence into chaos.

	The river watched, a silent witness, as the two titans fought. The Frogman’s agility matched the Mothman’s speed, but the air was electric with danger. With each strike, the stakes grew higher. The echoes of their growls and screeches filled the night, a haunting symphony that sent shivers down the spines of anyone close enough to hear.

	uddenly, the Mothman dove straight for the Frogman, aiming for his vulnerable belly. The Frogman twisted, narrowly avoiding the blow. He countered with a powerful leap, catching the Mothman off guard. A splash sent ripples across the river, but the Mothman was quick to recover.

Just as it seemed one would triumph, a blinding light flashed overhead. A group of locals, drawn by the commotion, shined their flashlights toward the river. The creatures paused, uncertainty hanging thick in the air.

	The Frogman glanced at the Mothman. They both knew they were losing their chance for supremacy. With a final, furious roar, the Mothman took to the skies, disappearing into the darkness. The Frogman watched as the shadow vanished, heart pounding.

	Victory was his, but it felt hollow. He remained on the bank, alone under the moonlight. Stories would tell of the battle, but who would remember the victor? The Ohio River kept its secrets, and the night swallowed them whole.

	And so, the legend of the Loveland Frogman grew, but whispers of the Mothman lingered. They both knew, deep down, that their rivalry was far from over. The night was alive with the promise of future confrontations, and the Ohio River would bear witness.
