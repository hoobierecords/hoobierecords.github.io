Scum Puppy - Pull My Finger (Sister Lakes Sasquatch Mix)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Yo, it’s Scum Puppy flippin’ the bird,
	Pull my finger, don’t say a word,
	This is the night of the giving head,
	Gum job zombies blow the vampiric undead.
	From the Lower Peninsula, where Dogman dwells,
	We stalk at night, hunting the hound from hell.
	Rockin’ with my crew, meltin’ your boom box,
	Hoobie life, baby, welcome to the boondocks.
[Chorus]
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger,
	Hoobie Records is rockin’ your granny like a West Michigan Sasquatch!
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger.
[Verse 2]
	Spittin’ Mad Libs like a lyrical priest,
	Casting fresh prints of the Dewey Lake beast,
	We call blastin’, tree knockin’, mad droppin’ beats,
	Investigating the Lake Macatawa Hazelbank retreat.
	From the Lower Peninsula, where Bigfoot creeps,
	Breakin’ out the night vision, we never sleep,
	Rockin’ with my crew, meltin’ your brain,
	Hoobie life, baby, can you smell the methane?
[Chorus]
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger,
	Hoobie Records is blowin’ a hole in your colon!
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger.
[Bridge]
	The treeline’s edge where the radio dies,  
	Static hums in the Dogman’s cries.  
	Black-eyed kids knockin’ at your door,  
	You ain’t freestylin' when the folklore roar.
[Chorus]
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger,
	Hoobie Records is dropping’ monster bangers like your mama drops her panties!
	Yo, pull my finger, lose your lunch, pull my finger.
