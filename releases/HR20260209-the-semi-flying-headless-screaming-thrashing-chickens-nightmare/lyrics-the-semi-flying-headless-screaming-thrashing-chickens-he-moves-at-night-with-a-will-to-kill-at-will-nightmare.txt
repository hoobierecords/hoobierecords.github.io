The Semi-Flying, Headless, Screaming, Thrashing Chickens - He Moves At Night With A Will To Kill At Will (Nightmare)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Hey, Bry, what do you think this knob does?
[Chorus]
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
[Verse]
	There's a killer stalking in your dreams,
	Don't let him hear your frightful screams!
	Don't turn back or waste time, just look ahead,
	Keep moving forward, he'll leave you for dead!
[Chorus]
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
[Verse]
	Evil's lurking  in your darkened sleep,
	Stay silent so not to make no a peep!
	Sinister motives, the killer is a guy who kills,
	He moves at night with a will to kill at will!
[Chorus]
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
[Bridge]
	Closing in fast, don't turn back,
	Always be ready for a surprise attack!
[Chorus]
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
	Nightmare! Nightmare!
	Nightmare! Fright Stare!
[Outro]
	Hey, Bry, just a gas.
