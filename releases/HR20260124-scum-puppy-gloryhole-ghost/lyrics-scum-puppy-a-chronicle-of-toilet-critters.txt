Scum Puppy - A Chronicle of Toilet Critters

Lyrics:

	In a bustling town, there was a public restroom known far and wide. People came and went, but few knew of its secret. Hidden within its porcelain confines lived the toilet goblins. Small, mischievous beings, they guarded the toilets fiercely. They loved their domain, but they had one rule: no one could enter without their permission.

	One day, Scum Puppy, a scruffy but brave dog, felt a pressing need. He had eaten too many discarded snacks from the park and now faced a dilemma. He needed to poop, and fast. He approached the restroom, hoping for relief.

	As he pushed the door open, the toilet goblins appeared. Their eyes sparkled with mischief, and they danced around in excitement. “You think you can just waltz in here?” one goblin sneered, his little arms crossed. “You must prove yourself worthy!”

	Scum Puppy felt the pressure build, but he knew better than to dismiss the goblins. He took a deep breath. “What do you want from me?”

	The goblins grinned. “Complete our challenge! Solve our riddle, and we’ll let you through.”

	They presented a riddle, twisted and tricky. “What runs but never walks, has a mouth but never talks?”

	Scum Puppy scratched his head, his mind racing. He thought of rivers, streams, and finally, he remembered. “A river!” he barked confidently.

	The goblins erupted in laughter. “Wrong! It’s a faucet!” They danced in circles, enjoying their trickery. Scum Puppy’s heart sank. He was so close to relief, yet so far.

	But Scum Puppy was not one to give up. He watched the goblins closely. They loved their game, but he noticed something. They also enjoyed the snacks left behind by the restroom visitors. Maybe he could use that to his advantage.

	“Wait!” Scum Puppy called out. “What if I bring you snacks? Would that make me worthy?”

	The goblins paused, interested. “Snacks? We love snacks!”

	“Then let me in, and I’ll bring you all the snacks you want!” Scum Puppy proposed, his tail wagging in hope.

	The goblins huddled together, whispering. Finally, they nodded. “Deal! But you better come back!”

	With a sigh of relief, Scum Puppy rushed inside. He finally found his moment of peace. As he finished, he hatched a plan. He dashed to the nearby park, gathering leftover food.

	When he returned, the goblins were waiting. Their eyes gleamed with anticipation. Scum Puppy laid out the feast before them. They squealed with joy, stuffing their tiny mouths.

	“Thank you, Scum Puppy!” they cheered, their bellies full. “You have shown us respect, and for that, you may enter any time!”

	Scum Puppy smiled, realizing the truth. Respect is key, even to those who seem small and silly. From that day on, he visited the restroom often, always bringing treats for the goblins.

	And so, the legend of Scum Puppy and the toilet goblins spread through the town. People learned to respect the little guardians of the porcelain throne. After all, a little kindness goes a long way, especially when it comes to small, mischievous beings.
