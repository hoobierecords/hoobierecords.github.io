Scum Puppy - Loveland Ohio (No Sleep Till Frogman)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	 "Hey... you... all... Carpetbagger here. It's two o'clock in the morning and I'm here outside of  Pexcho’s American Dime Museum in Augusta Georgia. I need to get to Loveland Ohio later this morning to attend the Loveland Frogman Festival. In order to make this happen, I'm going to drive straight through the night... Looks like it's no sleep till frogman!"
[Verse 1]
	Augusta Georgia, got my eye on the prize,
	Carpet-mobile super-charged on nitrous oxide!
	It's Loveland or bust, gotta make it on time,
	Not gonna miss the Frogman, a festival sublime!
	Cooler packed, snacks, Cheerwine and jerky,
	This long lonely road, might get kinda quirky!
	Got my podcast loaded, on cryptids and lore,
	Gotta see the Frogman, get on the festival floor!
	Into South Carolina northbound, let's get crackin',
	Keep my eyes peeled for cryptids, no slackin'!
	Got my camera in hand, ready for a photo op,
	Won't settle for less than a blurry blob Squatch!
	Into North Carolina, we have a long drive to go,
	With tooth picks propping' my eyelids up—whoa!
	Sittin' at the welcome center for a quick rest,
	Let's get rollin' to Loveland, this ain't no test!
[Chorus]
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	Gotta drive all night long,
	To where the frogmen all belong!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
[Verse 2]
	Highway hypnosis, or a delusional disorder,
	We just passed over the Tennessee border!
	Some red eye-shine about eight feet high,
	Mothman, Sasquatch, or other cryptid ally?!
	Mountains and darkness guide us on through,
	Next sign says, "Kentucky Welcomes You"!
	Closing' in on Frogman, at the butt crack of dawn,
	The festival is preparin', all I can do is yawn!
	Dogman howls in the early morning light,
	Those claws won't scratch us without a fight!
	He wipes the blood off his lips, he just ate,
	Torn remains of cryptid hunter, Monsterbait!
	Ohio river is shimmering, it's well into the morn,
	Almost to Loveland, where the legends are born!
	Parkin' the Carpet-mobile, we're finally here,
	Ready for the Frogman, to finally appear!
[Chorus]
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	Gotta drive all night long,
	To where the frogmen all belong!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
[Bridge] 
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
[Chorus]
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	No... sleep... 'til Frogman!
	Gotta drive all night long,
	To where the frogmen all belong!
	No... No!.. Sleep... Sleep!.. 'til Frogman!
