Jimson Sirkus - Silent Scream (Corpsewood Manor)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	The oaks whisper low where the road turns to dust,  
	And the gate swings wide with a shudder of rust.  
	They say lightning struck twice in the year '83,  
	Left two lovers in ashes beneath the old trees.  
	The lavish parties, filled with glee,
	Masked a despair that festered deep,
	A twisted, sordid tapestry,
	Where secrets buried, vigil keep.
[Chorus]
	Oh, Corpsewood Manor, your chimneys still sigh,  
	With the weight of the stars and a love gone awry.  
	No bible nor bullet could keep them apart,  
	So the devil himself signed the deed on their hearts.  
[Verse 2]
	The walls hold their secrets in peeling red paint,  
	Where the shadows dance slow in a ghost-light faint.  
	A preacher, a poet, a vow carved in bone,  
	Now the wind sings their names through the cracks in the stone.  
	Then came the night, a crimson stain,
	A brutal end, a shattered dream,
	Leaving behind a haunting pain,
	A silent scream, it would now seem.
[Chorus]
	Oh, Corpsewood Manor, your chimneys still sigh,  
	With the weight of the stars and a love gone awry.  
	No bible nor bullet could keep them apart,  
	So the devil himself signed the deed on their hearts.  
[Verse 3]
	The hunters came calling with fire in their hands,  
	But the house only laughed as it burned where it stands.  
	Some say when the moon hangs her head in the pines,  
	You can still hear them waltzing in slow, crooked lines.  
	Now only ruins, stand and stare,
	A testament to broken grace,
	A chilling ghost, hangs in the air,
	A lonely heart, in this desolate place.
[Chorus]
	Oh, Corpsewood Manor, your chimneys still sigh,  
	With the weight of the stars and a love gone awry.  
	No bible nor bullet could keep them apart,  
	So the devil himself signed the deed on their hearts.  
	So listen close, and heed the call,
	Of Corpsewood Manor's mournful plight,
	For in its shadows, stand we all,
	Lost in the darkness of the night.
[Outro]
	Now the weeds grow tall where the porch used to be,  
	And the crows pick the bones of their old revelry.  
	But don’t linger too long when the night starts to hum—  
	Corpsewood remembers, and Corpsewood is hungry.  
	"Corpsewood… they say… it never truly sleeps…"
