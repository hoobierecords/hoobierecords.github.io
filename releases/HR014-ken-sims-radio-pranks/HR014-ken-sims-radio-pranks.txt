Description:
	Radio Pranks by Ken Sims is a mischievous, laugh-out-loud collection of live prank calls that captures the unpredictable chaos of on-air radio. Throughout the album, Sims phones real radio stations and keeps the conversations going long enough for them to be broadcast live, creating unscripted comedy built on quick thinking and perfectly timed absurdity. Whether he’s pushing bizarre requests, inventing outrageous scenarios, or simply outwitting unsuspecting hosts, each track thrives on the tension between straight-laced radio professionalism and Sims’ relentless commitment to the bit.
	Spanning four tracks—“Beatles Radio,” “Mike Hunt,” the extended title track “Radio Pranks,” and the epic fifteen-minute closer “Wins”—the album showcases a range of setups and escalating antics. The longer cuts allow the jokes to build gradually, with DJs slowly realizing they’ve been caught in a prank while listeners remain glued to the unfolding spectacle. Compiled by Scum Puppy, Radio Pranks stands as a raw snapshot of guerrilla comedy, preserving the spontaneous, unfiltered energy of live radio hijacked by a fearless prankster.
