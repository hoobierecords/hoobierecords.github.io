Scum Puppy - West Michigan Dogman

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Midnight in Cadillac, fog rollin’ thick like smoke stacks,
	Paw prints in the snow but they ain't matchin’ no tracks.
	Grand Haven locals whisper ‘bout the bridge where it stands,
	Seven feet tall, claws like a butcher’s left hand.
	Muskegon cops got dashcam proof, grainy but true,
	Holland kids swear it howled in a tongue that ain’t new.
	Ludington’s woods got a hollowed-out den,
	Blood on the bark, no deer left to defend.
[Pre-Chorus]
	They callin’ it Dogman, half-beast, half myth,
	Saginaw to Kalamazoo, it’s a curse or a gift.
	Traverse City hikers vanished without a sound,
	All we found was a tooth in the ground.
[Chorus]
	Ey, it walks where the streetlights dim,
	From Benton Harbor straight up to Manistee’s rim.
	Ey, if you see it don’t blink, don’t stare,
	‘Cause the Dogman don’t care, the Dogman don’t care.
[Verse 2]
	Battle Creek lab boys dissectin’ fur samples,
	DNA twisted like a devil’s example.
	Portage County’s got a farmer missin’,
	Barn door ripped clean off its hinges.
	Coldwater Creek runnin’ red at dawn,
	Niles PD tossin’ files in the shredder by morn.
	South Haven’s preacher says it’s Judgment Day,
	While Saugatuck stoners swear it’s just DNA.
[Bridge]
	From St. Joseph’s docks to the Allegan pines,
	Eyewitnesses line up but they shiftin’ their signs.
	Marquette’s sayin’ wolf, Mount Pleasant says ghost,
	But the scars on my arm say it’s close, too close.
[Chorus]
	Ey, it walks where the streetlights dim,
	From Benton Harbor straight up to Manistee’s rim.
	Ey, if you see it don’t blink, don’t stare,
	‘Cause the Dogman don’t care, the Dogman don’t care.
[Outro]
	"Last sighting... Otsego...
	All units... proceed with caution...
	God help us, it’s learning the roads..."
