Scum Puppy - Mothman Vs. Frogman

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	On the banks of the Ohio River, shadows danced under the pale moonlight. The air was thick with tension, a chill creeping through the night. Whispers of an ancient rivalry hung like fog over the water. The Loveland Frogman, with his green, scaly skin and bulging eyes, prowled along the riverbank. He had long claimed these waters as his own.
	But tonight was different. The stillness cracked like thunder as the Point Pleasant Mothman emerged from the darkness. Tall and menacing, with wings that stretched wide, he glared down at the Frogman. Rumors had spread that a new challenger sought the title of supreme cryptid. Their eyes locked, both creatures knew what was coming.
[Verse 1]
	Ohio marsh, pale moon 	Frogs chant low, a grave-yard tune 	Black mud heaves, reeds draw tight 	Cold scales gleam in dying light 	Green eyes burn beneath the skin 	Water splits—he drags you in 	Bog-born king, ancient, grim 	Frogman wakes the swamp’s old hymn
[Pre-Chorus]
	Bridge groans slow, iron bends 	Static hums—this road ends 	Wings unfold, fate made flesh 	Red eyes burn the final breath
[Chorus]
	FEAR — THE — LEGEND 	FEAR — THE — FANG 	RIBBITS — DROWN 	WINGS — CLANG (HOLD) 	BLOOD AND SLIME 	SWAMP — GRAVE 	NO — ONE — LEFT 	TO — BE — SAVED
[Verse 2]
	Hooked claws tear the fog 	Wingbeats rot the river bog 	Mothman shrieks, steel-throat cry 	Red eyes cut the poisoned sky 	Feathers slick with filth and blood 	Prophecy drowned in flood 	Tongue like fire, whips and binds 	Swamp remembers ancient crimes
[Bridge]
	River churns with ancient hate 	Cryptid war seals human fate 	Point Pleasant bone and wire 	Loveland bile feeds the fire 	Flesh and myth in tidal pull 	Only one crawls from the null
[Chorus]
	FEAR — THE — LEGEND 	FEAR — THE — FANG 	RIBBITS — DROWN 	WINGS — CLANG
	BLOOD AND SLIME 	SWAMP — GRAVE 	NO — ONE — LEFT  	TO — BE — SAVED
[Outro] 	Dawn… won’t… come… 	Fog… won’t… lift… 	Footprints… sink… where none should live… 	Who… won? 	The… swamp…
