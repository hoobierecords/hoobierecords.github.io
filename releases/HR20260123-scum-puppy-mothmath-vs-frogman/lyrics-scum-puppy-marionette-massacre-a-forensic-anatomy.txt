Scum Puppy - Marionette Massacre (A Forensic Anatomy)

Lyrics:

	In the heart of Dallas, Texas, a story whispered among nightlife circles began to take form. It started in a small antique shop, where a dusty marionette hung silently on the wall. Its wooden limbs creaked as if waiting for the right moment to move. The shop owner warned anyone who showed interest. “That one’s cursed. Best leave it be.” But curiosity is a powerful force.

	Three friends—Sir Fletcher Munson Curve, Overlord, and Scum Puppy—were drawn to the marionette. They scoffed at the owner’s warning, convinced it was just a tale to scare off customers. Sir Fletcher, always the skeptic, was the first to reach for it. The moment his fingers touched the wooden face, a chill swept through the room. The marionette’s eyes seemed to glint with a life of their own.

	That night, they gathered at Overlord's apartment to celebrate their new find. The marionette sat in the corner, watching them. They joked and laughed, but an uneasy feeling settled in the air. Scum Puppy felt a shiver run down his spine. “Maybe we should get rid of it,” he muttered. The others laughed. They were having too much fun.

	As the clock struck midnight, the laughter faded. Sir Fletcher, feeling bold, declared he would make the marionette dance. He picked it up and began to manipulate the strings. The marionette jerked to life, its movements unnatural and eerie. Suddenly, it stopped. A low, sinister giggle echoed through the room.

	The lights flickered. Sir Fletcher dropped the marionette in fear. It fell to the floor and lay still. But the air grew cold. The marionette began to rise. It moved with a speed that was terrifying. Sir Fletcher backed away, but it lunged, its wooden hand slashing across his throat. He fell to the ground, gasping for air.

	Overlord froze, horrified. “What just happened?” He barely had time to process before the marionette turned its gaze on him. It was relentless. It lunged again, its strings snapping, as it darted toward him. He tried to run, but the marionette was quicker. In a blink, it was upon him, its sharp wooden fingers digging into his flesh.

	Scum Puppy was left alone, panic igniting in his chest. He stumbled back, looking for a way out. The marionette fixed its beady eyes on him, sensing his fear. As he sprinted toward the door, the marionette's laughter filled the room. It was a sound that would haunt him forever. He could feel the darkness closing in.

	Just as he reached for the doorknob, it lunged one last time. It caught his ankle, dragging him down. The last thing he saw was its sinister grin before darkness enveloped him.

	Days later, the antique shop owner noticed the marionette was missing. People began to talk. They whispered of three friends who had vanished without a trace, their laughter replaced by eerie silence. The marionette was seen again, lurking in the shadows of Dallas, waiting for its next victims.

	And so, the tale of the cursed marionette spread, a chilling reminder of the dangers that lie in curiosity, echoing through the night.
