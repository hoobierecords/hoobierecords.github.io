Scum Puppy - Case Files of the Marionette Massacre

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Step lively, splinters in the moonlight,
	Midnight maestro, shadow in a pinstripe.
	No puppeteer, I’m the one who cut the strings,
	Now I orchestrate a symphony of bloody things.
	Creepin’ where the lamp flickers,
	Blade in my hand, heart beatin’ quicker,
	Tappin’ on your window with a wooden knuckle,
	You prayin’ for a sequel, I’m the end of the shuffle.
	Joints clickin’, marionette walk,
	No conscience, just a bone to stalk,
	That red on my blade, got a story to talk.
	Your scream is the hook, now watch me rock.
	Eyes painted wide, no mercy in sight,
	Movin’ like a rumor in the pitch-black night,
	If you hear the creak, better hold on tight,
	Ain’t no happy endings when I write.
[Chorus]
	Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	I said: Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who the shadow in town, bringin’ fear to life?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Welcome to the puppet’s knife!
[Verse 2]
	No heartbeat, just a tick in the gears,
	I glide through the alley while you drown in your fears.
	Face painted on, smile stitched with dread,
	Every footstep’s a word in the book of the dead.
	I don’t dance, I dictate the rhythm,
	Wooden frame, cold aim, straight schism,
	Got the town playin’ victim,
	Blood on my blade, that’s my emblem.
	Look in my eyes, see the grain and the grime,
	No lifeline, just a deadline,
	If you hear the music box wind,
	You too late, your fate just signed.
	Got a list, crossin’ out every name,
	No pity, no shame,
	They all puppets, I’m the only one untamed!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Chills in your spine when the moonlight bites.
	You can’t outrun the strings of the night.
	Crimson confetti and the splatter ignite.
	The curtains fall, but I’m still in sight.
	Peekaboo!
[Chorus]
	Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	I said: Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who the shadow in town, bringin’ fear to life?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Welcome to the puppet’s knife!
[Bridge]
	No silver screen, this a real nightmare,
	Tick-tock, I’m already there.
	Blood drips to the rhythm of my wooden feet,
	Stage set in the silence of your dying street.
	You can scream, but the ropes so tight,
	I pull this finger in the dead of night.
	This ain’t fiction, this a splintered life.
	One cut, two step, and I vanish from sight.
[Chorus]
	Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	I said: Who runnin’ the night with a steak knife?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who the shadow in town, bringin’ fear to life?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The string puppet slayer!
	Who’s got your strings in a vice?
	The marionette blood sprayer!
	Welcome to the puppet’s knife!
[Outro]
	Curtain falls, but I linger in the dark,
	Painted smile, signature mark,
	Tonight, marionette got the starring part—
	Hide your hearts, I collect ‘em for art—
	Next time, don’t blink...
