Description:
	Show Me... by ReeKoWard is a refreshing, intimate collection of acoustic tracks that highlights the raw synergy between ReeKoWard’s vocals and the bright, percussive tones of the ukulele. Clocking in at just over 11 minutes, the album is a masterclass in brevity, delivering punchy, emotional snapshots that range from the soulful title track to the more irreverent energy of "Shithead." The stripped-back production allows the natural resonance of the ukulele to shine, creating an "in-the-room" atmosphere that feels both personal and unpolished in the best way possible.
	The songwriting across the five tracks balances vulnerability with a sharp, contemporary edge. While "Beauty Inside" offers a moment of melodic reflection, "Waste Your Time" showcases a more rhythmic, driving side of ReeKoWard’s playing style. Each song stays within a tight two-minute window, ensuring that the listener is left wanting more while perfectly capturing the essence of modern indie-folk. It’s an honest, no-frills debut that proves you don’t need a full band to make a lasting impression—just a four-stringed instrument and a story to tell.
