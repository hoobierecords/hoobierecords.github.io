	Meat Scones by The Pickle is a gonzo comedy album that thrives on chaos, awkward pauses, WTF, and the kind of unearned confidence that makes bad ideas sound brilliant. The performances feel loose and deliberately unpolished, with The Pickle leaning into rambling monologues, unexpected turns, and punchlines that often arrive sideways—or not at all. It has the energy of someone holding court at 1 a.m., insisting a story is going somewhere, and somehow being right.

	What makes Meat Scones work is its commitment to the idiodic. The humor is absurd, self-aware, and stubbornly committed, finding laughs in repetition, discomfort, and sheer nonsense. Beneath the silliness is a sharp sense of timing and an understanding of how far to push a joke before it collapses, which is often exactly the point. The album feels less like a collection of tracks and more like being trapped in a room with a very funny, very strange person—and realizing you don’t actually want to leave.

	First off this cd-r release is unadulterated, juvenile, gonzo humor. With that being stated let's discuss the release. The opening track, "Meat Scones (Part 1)," catches The Pickle narrating a story (while driving his car) in which he was to purchase some scones. This in itself is not exceptionally, but it is when you hear hear him cursing at other drivers that the pure comedy begins. In the 2nd track, "Injuring Illegals (Part 1)," and 6th track, "Injuring Illegals (Part 2)," The Pickle weighs the value of human life and makes (il)logical comparisons to road kill. The 4th track, "Cow Toilet Paper," is a classic... total ingenuity! The cd-r continues with many more tracks of bizarre laughing, bad jokes, and weird situations. Highly recommended for those who enjoy nonsensical, whacked-out humor.
