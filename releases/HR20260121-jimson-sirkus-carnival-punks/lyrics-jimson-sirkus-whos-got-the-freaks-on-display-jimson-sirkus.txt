Jimson Sirkus - Who’s Got the Freaks On Display? (Jimson Sirkus!)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Step right up, let me paint ya a vision,
	Bopo in the spot, redefine your tradition, 
	Grin cracked wide—no joke, just precision,
	Spit balloon animals, bite beats like incisions.
	Hear yee, hear yee, it's Scum Puppy with tha wicked stanza!
	I'm tha purveyor of ill repute and tha clown porn extravaganza!
	Snare’s on fire, I’m a beast in the ring,
	Torch in my throat while the cymbals swing,
	Soot in my veins, every fill got a sting,
	I’m that dog with a howl, let the chaos sing.
[Pre-Chorus]
	This ain’t no circus, it’s a... spell it out... S-I-R-K-U-S,
	Jesters and monsters, rewiring your fate,
	Back alley carnies with the world on our plate,
	We juggle your mind, every rhyme checkmate.
[Chorus]
	Who Rocks the midway?
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Who’s got the freaks on display?
	Jimson Sirkus! 
	Who's ripping cages and chains?
	Jimson Sirkus! 
	Yeah, we’re that gang—
	Unleash the beast, let the shadows bang!
[Verse 2]
	We ain’t your average tent—nah, we freak with flair,
	Bass thumps from Hokey, make your nightmares stare,
	Scum Puppy’s breathing, got the flame in the snare,
	Bally’s six strings saw your soul midair.
	Crawl through the flames, I’m the freak they adore,
	Molten metronome, I’m the heartbeat of war,
	Soot suit, black boots, watch me scorch the floor,
	With the Sirkus behind, man, you can’t ignore!
[Chorus]
	Who Rocks the midway?
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Who’s got the freaks on display?
	Jimson Sirkus! 
	Who's ripping cages and chains?
	Jimson Sirkus! 
	Yeah, we’re that gang—
	Unleash the beast, let the shadows bang!
[Bridge]
	Strings razor sharp, carve a melody mask,
	No rabbits in hats—just an axe and a flask.
	Step right up Chump, pull my finger!
	Lose your lunch, my aroma lingers!
	Bass so low, make the ground collapse,
	Shivers in your marrow, we conduct the relapse.
	Spotlights flicker, we the ones in the smoke,
	Back alley legends, your heroes went broke.
[Chorus]
	Who Rocks the midway?
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Who paints the night with flame?
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Who's breaking every chain?
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Yeah, we’re that gang—
	Unleash the beast, let the shadows bang!
[Outro]
	Painted faces, melting fear in the crowd,
	We the masters of the ring, screaming freak and proud.
	From the gutter to the spotlight, we built this sound,
	Jimson Sirkus, worldbound—
	Now scream it Loud!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	Jimson Sirkus!
	All facts, all real, yeah we too hype!
