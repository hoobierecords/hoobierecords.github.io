Scum Puppy - Prefix Skullduggery

Lyrics:

[Verse]
	They slid a zero on the table, whispered base‑ten lies,
	Swapped your inches for a secret in centimeter disguise.
	Popped a liter in the soda, stole a pound from your plate,
	Now the kilo’s makin’ deals at the back of the state.
	Agents with protractors, suits with measurin' spoons,
	Plottin' in Paris, under neon metric moons.
	They say it’s tidy, simple — just move the decimal left,
	But your backyard BBQ feels bereft, bereft!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Who’s takin’ my furlong?
	Who took my yard?
	Who’s stealin’ inches in the night?
[Chorus]
	It’s the Evil Metric System Conspiracy!
	Centimeters, liters, kilos — they’re messin’ with me!
	Deci‑plot on the low, decimal mind control,
	Check your rulers, check your cups, who erased the foot pole?
[Verse]
	They got a cartel of calculators, graph paper spies,
	Countin' everything in tens while they hide the pies.
	“Just divide, multiply” — they smile with a slide rule,
	The geometry’s a gangster, the triangle’s a fool.
	From the kitchen to the garage, conversions in the mist,
	You reach for a wrench, it’s a millimeter twist.
	We used to rock the footstool, now it’s all so clinical,
	A latte in a liter? Man, that’s just cynical.
[Bridge]
	Convert it! Convert it! 2.54 — remember that!
	They keep your brain doin' math while they take your habitat!
	Watch the rulers, watch the clocks, watch the graph paper fold,
	This ain’t science fiction — it’s a decimal stronghold!
[Verse]
	Neon signs - “Centri‑central,” downtown measurement mart,
	Sellin’ fractions in the alley like it’s some kind of art.
	Kilogram kingpin with a crown of slate,
	Tradin' ounces for secrets behind a metric gate.
	Celsius on the thermostat, Fahrenheit in your dreams,
	They swapped your weather for a number that redeems.
	But we ain’t fooled — we got feet, we got appetite,
	We’ll stomp centimeters into the street tonight!
[Pre-Chorus]
	Who moved my inch?
	Who flipped my pound?
	Who signed the treaty at the metric town square?
[Chorus]
	It’s the Evil Metric System Conspiracy!
	Centimeters, liters, kilos — they’re messin’ with me!
	They want base ten in your brain, metric chains on your toys,
	But we measure our mischief in feet, stakes, and noise!
[Bridge]
	Hoobie!
	Hoobie!
	Hoobie!
	Hoobie!
	Listen to the tape — beep beep — convert! convert!
	Scratch it up, break it down, throw the ruler in the dirt!
	Hey! Yo! Flip the scale! Whoo!
[Verse]
	So we grabbed a yardstick, formed a secret club,
	Mapped the alley in inches, signed with a stub.
	We’ll drink from pint glasses, keep the footlight bright,
	Raise a toast to the odd, to the wrongside of right.
	No spreadsheet can capture the way we dance and sing,
	No metric manifesto gonna clip our wing.
	Keep your deci‑mystery, your centimeter scheme,
	We’ll keep our messy measures and dethrone your dream!
[Chorus]
	It’s the Evil Metric System Conspiracy!
	Centimeters, liters, kilos — they’re messin’ with me!
	Hands on the rulers, feet on the ground,
	We’ll laugh at the decimals, make a rebel sound!
	Evil Metric System Conspiracy!
	Evil Metric System Conspiracy!
[Outro]
	Keep your math, keep your base ten, keep your neat little plot,
	We’ll keep our odd little inches — messier, louder, hot.
	Peace, love, rulers — and a wink to the sky,
	We saw the conspiracy — and we measured it by eye!
