Scum Puppy - Pope Lick Monster Vs. Jersey Devil (Beast Battle 1-1)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Announcer:
		"Ladies and Gentlemen! Get ready for our main event...
		Two monster legends will now battle it out for the title of Cryptid King.
		In this corner, hailing from Pope Lick Kentucky...
		Give it up for The Pope Lick Monster!"
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Yo, Jersey Devi, lemme drop some lyrical truth on you cryptid ass clown!
		This ain't no urban legend, this is Pope Lick town!"
	Announcer:
		"And in this corner, from the New Jersey Pine Berrens...
		Raise the roof for the Jersey Devil!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Yo, Pope Lick Foo, You're just a blurry photo, a second-rate note!
		I'm in the history books, the urban legend G-O-A-T!"
	Announcer:
		"Let the battle begin!"
[Verse 1]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Jersey Devil, more like Jersey Failure, face it, you a joke!
		Flying around Pine Barrens, choking on leafy smoke!
		While I'm here chillin' under the bridge, architecting dread!
		You're still stuck with that goat head, wishes you were dead!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no campfire tale!
		It's the Devil from the Pines, about to make your legend fail!
		Pope Lick Monster? More like a Pope Lick fraud!
		Hiding under train trestles, praying nobody saw!"
[Chorus 1]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Pope Lick's in the house! Where the fear is amplified!
		Jersey Devil weak sauce, get your weak tail sanitized!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Pope Lick POSER! You a Kentucky Klutz!
		While I'm flying over Hammonton, eating your goat nuts!"
[Verse 2]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Been hearin' whispers 'bout your claws and your screeches high,
		But all I hear is crickets while the trains are passin' by!
		You terrorize some backwoods, preying on the weak and mild,
		I'm temptin' daredevils, driving 'em absolutely wild!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Heard you got some goat legs and horns, ain't nothin' new,
		I got a horse head, bat wings, and cloven hooves too!
		But I ain't hiding in the shadows, fearing the daylight,
		I'm soaring through the pinelands, giving folks a fright!"
[Chorus 2]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"You're a legend lost in the fog, a forgotten fright!
		Pope Lick's the main attraction, under the pale moonlight!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"!Dissed and dismissed, you're a legend going stale!
		Go back to your trestle, and just freaking wail!"
[Bridge]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"You think you're scary? You just loud, a noisy, flappin' wings!
		I'm the silent predator, the nightmare terror brings!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Got kids screaming your name, more sad than terrified!
		While I'm inspiring fear, and keeping legends alive!"
[Verse 3]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"I'm the Pope Lick Monster, the king of the railroad track!
		You're just a forgotten fable, ain't no turnin' back!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"I got sightings reported for centuries, son!
		From the swamps of South Jersey to the Pine Baron's run!"
[Chorus 3]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Pope Lick's in the house! Where the fear is amplified!
		Jersey Devil weak sauce, get your weak tail sanitized!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Pope Lick Poser! You a Kentucky Klutz!
		While I'm flying over Hammonton, eating your goat nuts!"
