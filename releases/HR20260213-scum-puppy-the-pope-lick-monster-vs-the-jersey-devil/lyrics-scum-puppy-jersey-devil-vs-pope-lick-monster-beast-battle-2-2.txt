Scum Puppy - Jersey Devil Vs. Pope Lick Monster (Beast Battle 2-2)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Announcer:
		"Ladies and Gentlemen! Get ready for our main event...
		Two monster legends will now battle it out for the title of Cryptid King ...
		In this corner, hailing from Pope Lick Kentucky...
		Give it up for The Pope Lick Monster!"
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Yo, Jersey Devi, lemme drop some lyrical truth on you cryptid ass clown!
		This ain't no urban legend, this is Pope Lick town!"
	Announcer:
		"And in this corner, from the New Jersey Pine Berrens...
		Raise the roof for the Jersey Devil!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Yo, Pope Lick Foo, You're just a blurry photo, a second-rate note!
		I'm in the history books, the urban legend G-O-A-T!"
	Announcer:
		"Let the battle begin!"
[Verse 1]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Heard you got a batwing, breathin' fire, what a shame!
		Can't even toast a marshmallow, just playin' a weak game!
		You a chimera mess, lookin' like a bad taxidermy!
		While I'm half-goat, half-man, bringin' the Kentucky derby!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"That goat-legged, humanoid, Kentucky-fried disgrace!
		You ain't scary, you dusty, lost in time and space!
		I'm born of Leeds' 13th child, a legend in the making!
		While you're clinging to a myth, your relevance is breaking!"
[Chorus 1]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"Pope Lick's in the house! Where the fear is amplified!
		Jersey Devil weak sauce, get your weak tail sanitized!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Pope Lick POSER! You a Kentucky Klutz!
		While I'm flying over Hammonton, eating your goat nuts!"
[Verse 2]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"See, you rely on darkness, hiding from the afternoon!
		I stand right in the sunlight, howlin' at the harvest moon!
		You're a relic from the colonies, a story old and lame!
		I'm a modern monster, burnin' in the local fame!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"You got a train myth, I got a whole state trembling!
		Your story's weak, your reputation's crumbling!
		You think you're tough? I breathe fire, son, real flame!
		You're just a sideshow attraction, a forgettable name!"
[Chorus 2]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"You're a legend lost in the fog, a forgotten fright!
		Pope Lick's the main attraction, under the pale moonlight!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Dissed and dismissed, you're a legend going stale!
		Go back to your trestle, and just freaking wail!"
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"They say you got a fiery breath, that you breathe upon the trees!
		But I got a mind control, that brings people to their knees!"
	Jersey Devil:	
		"Yeah, you think you're slick, hiding in the dark!
		But the truth is out, you're just a lonely, smelly mark!"
[Verse 3]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"So go back to your pine trees, hide your ugly face!
		'Cause the Pope Lick Monster just put you in your place!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"So step aside, little goat-face, your time is through!
		The Jersey Devil's on top, and I'm coming for you!"
[Chorus 3]
	Pope Lick Monster:
		"You're a legend lost in the fog, a forgotten fright!
		Pope Lick's the main attraction, under the pale moonlight!"
	Jersey Devil:
		"Jersey Devil's in the house, undisputed reign!
		You're a blurry crypto-joke, lost in the folklore stain!"
