Description:
A Sweaty Meat Sextraveganza! by Jeremy’s Enormous Meat Tray is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it blast of greasy, tongue-in-cheek hard rock that barrels through five tracks in just over five minutes. From the explosive 26-second opener “Jeremy’s Tower Of Power” to the swaggering stomp of “Meat Master,” the album thrives on punchy riffs, ridiculous bravado, and a knowing sense of absurdity. “More Meat” doubles down on the band’s maximalist appetite for distortion and hooks, while “A Big Veiny Dick” showcases Jack-Off Jo-Jo’s flashy fretwork in a tight, high-voltage burst.

Closing track “Cum Like A Gorilla” stretches things out (by this album’s standards) into a fuzz-drenched, chest-thumping finale that lets the whole band flex. Jeremy Joy-Stick’s over-the-top vocals ride atop Sausage Sarn’s thick, bouncing basslines and Teabaggin’ Trent’s relentless, cymbal-crashing energy. Equal parts parody and powerhouse, A Sweaty Meat Sextraveganza! feels like a sweaty basement show crammed onto tape—loud, ridiculous, and completely committed to the bit.
