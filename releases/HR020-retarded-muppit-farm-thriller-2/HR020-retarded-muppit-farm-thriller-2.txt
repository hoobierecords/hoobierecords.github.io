Description:
Thriller 2 by Retarded Muppit Farm is a fast-paced, genre-blurring collection that balances absurdist humor with surprisingly earnest songwriting. Clocking in with a mix of ultra-short bursts like the 37-second opener “Thriller 2” and punchy interludes such as “Metal Song,” the album thrives on unpredictability. Tracks like “People In Love,” “Take Me Higher (Than Heaven),” and “Beautiful Feelings” showcase a melodic, almost power-pop sensibility, while songs such as “Little Wooden Soldiers” and “The Song (Still) Remains The Same” hint at playful experimentation with classic rock structures. The sequencing keeps listeners on their toes, shifting quickly between sincerity and satire.

Collaboration plays a key role in shaping the album’s eclectic tone. Guest vocalists April Showers and David Anger bring added energy to “Tuff Guys,” while Joo’s appearances on “Oklahoma” and “The King Of The Road” add character-driven flair. GYN’s musical contributions on “MILF Moustache” and “Untitled” expand the sonic palette even further, giving the record a loosely collaborative, jam-session spirit. From the tongue-in-cheek swagger of “Ronald Reagan” to the extended closer “Jump Off The Slide,” Thriller 2 feels intentionally chaotic yet tightly curated—a collage of humor, hooks, and offbeat creativity that refuses to sit still.
