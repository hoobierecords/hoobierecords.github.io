Description:
Scurvy, Overindulgence And A Wooden Lip by Captain Big Old Blue barrels in like a sea-soaked tall tale, equal parts swagger and self-parody. The album feels drenched in salt air and excess, with songs that lurch between raucous energy and grimy, grin-through-the-pain humor. There’s a rough-hewn, nautical grit to the sound, as if each track was carved out of driftwood and bad decisions, favoring character and momentum over polish. It’s loud, stubborn, and unapologetically indulgent.

Beneath the boisterous surface, the album carries a wry awareness of its own absurdity. Captain Big Old Blue leans into themes of decay, indulgence, and bravado with a wink, letting exaggerated imagery and larger-than-life delivery do the heavy lifting. The result is a record that feels mythic in a scrappy, barroom-legend way—songs that don’t ask to be taken seriously, but reward listeners who lean in anyway. Scurvy, Overindulgence And A Wooden Lip ultimately thrives on its commitment to excess, turning chaos into a strangely cohesive and memorable voyage.
