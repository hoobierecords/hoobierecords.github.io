The Semi-Flying, Headless, Screaming, Thrashing Chickens - Lucifer’s Lounge

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	On Hazelbank’s estate where the maple shadows lean,
	In Holland, Michigan, where the winters cut clean,
	P. T. Cheff walked paths with a furnace-born flame,
	Dreaming heat into homes, stamping iron with a name.
	The Holland Furnace Company hissed, roared, and grew,
	Brick by brick, coil by coil, ambition rang true.
	Smoke curled like secrets above brick and gate,
	As wealth found its way to the Hazelbank estate.
	But beneath warm air and profit, a colder note floats,
	Whispered late at night by the Exalted Order of Goats.
	Symbols carved softly where lamplight would fail,
	Oaths thicker than soot, old power gone pale.
	Was it industry, ritual, or myth over time,
	That braided these stories in reason and rhyme?
	The furnace still breathes and the grounds still wait,
	For answers sealed deep in Hazelbank’s gate.
[Chorus]
	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Lucifer's lounge.
[Verse]
	P.T. Cheff was his name,
	When it came to spooks he played the game,
	His true intentions, we'll never know,
	We investigate to find a friend or foe.
[Pre-Chorus]
	A mystery man stalks the grounds,
	A super psycho makes his rounds,
	This ain't no rumor, this ain't no joke,
	Catch the wave, enjoy a coke.
[Chorus]
	Hazelbank shuffle, yeah, we move in the night,
	Hazelbank shuffle, flicker low candlelight,
	Hazelbank shuffle, hear the old floorboards thump,
	Hazelbank shuffle, feel the bass in the crypt,
	Hazelbank shuffle, secrets spin in a trance,
	Hazelbank shuffle, devil’s favorite dance,
	Hazelbank shuffle, where the truth don’t budge,
	Down in **Lucifer’s Lounge**, let the shadows judge.
[Verse]

	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Hazelbank shuffle,
	Lucifer's lounge.
[Bridge]
	Hey man, where's the beat?
	Hazelbank estate, Holland frost in the air,
	Cheff lit the fire, made the cold disappear,
	Holland Furnace booming, metal lungs breathe,
	But secrets in the brickwork way deeper than heat.
	Exalted Order of Goats, whispered code in the halls,
	Symbols in the shadows where the lamplight falls,
	Industry or ritual, truth blend with fate,
	Mystery still burning at Hazelbank’s gate.
[Pre-Chorus]
	A mystery man stalks the grounds,
	A super psycho makes his rounds,
	This ain't no rumor, this ain't no joke,
	Catch the wave, enjoy a coke.
[Chorus]
	Hazelbank shuffle, yeah, we move in the night,
	Hazelbank shuffle, flicker low candlelight,
	Hazelbank shuffle, hear the old floorboards thump,
	Hazelbank shuffle, feel the bass in the crypt,
	Hazelbank shuffle, secrets spin in a trance,
	Hazelbank shuffle, devil’s favorite dance,
	Hazelbank shuffle, where the truth don’t budge,
	Down in **Lucifer’s Lounge**, let the shadows judge.
[Outro]
	Hey man, where's the beat?
	Hey Bry, did I ever tell you about my gobots?
