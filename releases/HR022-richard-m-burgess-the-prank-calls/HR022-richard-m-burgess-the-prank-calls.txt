Description:
	The Prank Calls by Richard M. Burgess is a spoken-word style audio album built around a series of repeated prank calls made to Burgess by an unknown caller. Structured into multi-part tracks, the album presents the conversations as they unfold, capturing the escalating absurdity, confusion, and dark humor of the exchanges. Each scenario—ranging from “Big Brothers, Little Bros.” to “Magazine Subscription”—plays out in segments, giving listeners an unfiltered look at the persistence and unpredictability of the prankster’s storytelling. The episodic format creates a raw, almost documentary-like feel, as though the audience is listening in on real-time interactions.
	Across its sixteen tracks, the album blends awkward comedy, shock value, and social satire, with recurring themes that push boundaries and test Burgess’s patience. The prank caller adopts a variety of outrageous premises, often escalating them over multiple parts to heighten tension and absurdity. While the subject matter can be provocative, the album ultimately functions as an audio chronicle of endurance and reaction, highlighting the strange dynamics between anonymous callers and their unsuspecting targets. The result is an unconventional listening experience that sits somewhere between prank call compilation, performance art, and candid audio diary.
