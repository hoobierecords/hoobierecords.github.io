Scum Puppy - Alabama White Thang (Cry Baby Holler Mix)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Midnight—moonshine's flicker in the piney grove,
	Something stalks the silence where the blacktop goes,
	Whisper in the kudzu, hush—don’t breathe,
	Eyes wide as saucers, what you wish to believe?
	Alabama dusk, thick with stories untold,
	Phantom in the cotton fields, bone-white and cold,
	Moves like a ghost, but it’s muscle and heat,
	Cracking limbs underfoot, with impossible speed.
	Ancient as the holler, born in folklore’s cradle,
	They say it walks upright, but it’s nothing like fable,
	Flash between the trailers, haunt of hounds and men,
	If you seen it, you don’t talk, you don’t sleep again.
	No tracks in the morning, no howl, no sign,
	Just a chill in the marrow and a shiver down the spine,
	Who’s out there, lurking where the campfire can’t reach?
	White as a winter storm, but the summer’s a beast.
[Pre	Chorus 1]
	Brindlee Mountain’s got a secret to keep,
	Big Nance Creek runs shallow but deep.
	Bankhead Forest don’t sleep at night,
	Guntersville Park’s got a thing in white.
[Chorus 1]
	Out in the woods where the wild don’t sleep,
	White Thang prowl, got secrets to keep.
	You ain’t seen nothing till you seen it for real,
	It ain’t just a myth, it’s the chill that you feel.
	Something’s still out there, covered in fur,
	Guntersville State Park, it’s startin’ to stir.
	Bankhead Forest, Big Nance Creek,
	You don’t find it… it finds you, freak.
[Verse 2]
	Granddaddy sips his bourbon, whispers names he won’t say,
	Swears he saw it cross the creek at the break of day,
	Twisted legend, running silent through the kudzu maze,
	Eyes like lanterns, soul ablaze.
	Not a bear, not a wolf, not a trick of the mind,
	Something primal, with a rage that the woods designed,
	Past shotgun shells and the preacher’s prayer,
	It slinks through the myth, leaving locals in despair.
	Swamp’s got secrets, and the hills got bones,
	You come looking for answers, better come alone,
	No camera flashes, no city lights,
	Only moss-hung branches and sleepless nights,
	It’s deeper than fear, it’s a shadow on the land,
	The hush before thunder, a beast unmanned,
	The tale’s in the telling, the proof’s in the pain,
	Deep woods whisper the name—White Thang.
[Pre Chorus 2]
	Lacey’s Spring to Somerville, they swear it’s near,
	Cotaco nights fill the air with fear.
	Bankhead Forest, Big Nance Creek,
	That phantom shriek leave your knees weak.
[Chorus 2]
	Out in the woods where the wild don’t sleep,
	White Thang prowl, got secrets to keep.
	You ain’t seen nothing till you seen it for real,
	It ain’t just a myth, it’s the chill that you feel.
	Something’s still out there, covered in fur,
	Guntersville State Park, it’s startin’ to stir.
	Bankhead Forest, Big Nance Creek,
	You don’t find it… it finds you, freak.
[Bridge]
	Deep South whispers, Northern Alabama hums,
	Morgan County nights where the White Thang runs.
	Eight feet tall, with fur all white,
	Glowing red eyes sneak through the night.
	Unseen critter hidden in the pines,
	Shrieks cut sharp through the moon's shine,
	Sound like a woman, or like a child weepin’,
	Courtland’s Slough Thang got the whole town creepin’.
[Chorus 3]
	Out in the woods where the wild don’t sleep,
	White Thang prowl, got secrets to keep.
	You ain’t seen nothing till you seen it for real,
	It ain’t just a myth, it’s the chill that you feel.
	Something’s still out there, covered in fur,
	Guntersville State Park, it’s startin’ to stir.
	Bankhead Forest, Big Nance Creek,
	You don’t find it… it finds you, freak.
[Outro]
	Alabama shadow, never caught, never tamed,
	White Thang’s legend burns in the backwoods flame.
	In the Deep South, where the tall tales hang,
	You don’t choose the legend—the legend choose your name.
