The Semi-Flying, Headless, Screaming, Thrashing Chickens - Singeing My Ass Hair

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Hey, Bry... do you think I could light my fart on fire?
[Chorus]
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas when I sit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas before I shit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
[Verse]
	I'm not lying, I'm really good
	If you haven't heard me, you should.
	I can usually tear out my seams,
	With one good blast in my jeans.
	Okay, maybe that was an exaggeration,
	But my middle name is methane gas station.
[Chorus]
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas when I sit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas before I shit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
[Verse]
	In class, at home, it doesn't matter,
	My farts will make everybody scatter.
	Picasso, Mozart, and Da Vinci got nothing on me,
	One wiff of my artistry will make them all flee.
	If your'e looking for the best fart in town,
	Look no further than me, I'm a real fart clown.
[Chorus]
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas when I sit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas before I shit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
[Bridge]
	Fart, fart, fart, farty fart fart!
	Fart, fart, fart, farty fart fart!
	Fart, fart, fart, farty fart fart!
	Fart, fart, fart, farty fart fart!
[Chorus]
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas when I sit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	I can fart and I'm good at it,
	I pass gas before I shit.
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
	Fartin' is my art! Fartin' is his art!
[Outro]
	Fart, fart, fart, farty fart fart!
	Hey, Bry... just a gas
