Description:
Death Killers by Death Killers is a chaotic, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it blast of lo-fi punk fronted by an unlikely and unforgettable voice: six-year-old vocalist Ally. Across seventeen tracks—most barely cracking the two-minute mark—the album barrels through absurd humor, playground taunts, surreal imagery, and flashes of strangely sharp emotional honesty. Songs like “I’ll Be Your Death,” “Yo Mama,” and “Your Mother Is Dead (She Lives In Your Head)” collide dark themes with childlike delivery, creating a disorienting mix of innocence and menace. Meanwhile, tracks such as “What Did The Purple Dog Say,” “There Ain’t No Boogers (In This, Bud),” and “Why Do Kids Always Ask Those Stupid Questions” lean fully into the unfiltered logic of childhood, sounding equal parts comedy sketch and basement punk manifesto.

Musically, the band keeps things raw and immediate. Zak’s jagged guitar work and Tim’s stripped-down bass, guitar, and drums provide a scrappy, DIY backdrop that feels recorded in the moment—fast, fuzzy, and unapologetically rough around the edges. The ultra-short runtimes give the record a breathless, almost improvisational energy, as if each idea was captured the instant it sparked. The result is an album that feels both confrontational and strangely playful—an offbeat punk experiment where youthful spontaneity crashes headfirst into garage-band aggression, leaving behind something bizarre, funny, and unexpectedly memorable.
