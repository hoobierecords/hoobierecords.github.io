Death Killers - Death Killers

I recommend the Death Killers' debut and final album, "Death Killers."

Admittedly, the idea of a punk rock/ultra lo fi trio with a 6 year old singer and lyricist would not necessarily appeal. I might listen, but with the absolute expectation that it would be shit. I enjoy some outsider music, homemade and unconventional music. So I can appreciate lo'er than lo fi. So I had a listen.

Turns out, while the fi is lo, this kid is great. She was taught at some point that punk rock is about expressing anger and confronting taboos, so she leans on the "why are you asking stupid questions?" and "we're going to kill your cat!" side of things. But she'll win you over with lyrics like "so be alarmed for your cat, keep your eye on your cat," songs about training toilets, and her considerable beat boxing skills. She can shout, too, and convincingly. She's a punk rock dynamo.

Her two teenage band members, one of whom is her brother, provide music that is, at times, improvised, completely out of tune (detuned?), with wandering tempos and diabolical plucking and rough strumming of various punk rock riff fragments. They tighten it up for a handful of speedy, more-conventional sounding tracks, semi-arranged complete with bass and drums.

Almost everything on the record is sped up a bit, which helps rock the punk. And the faster it goes, the sooner you can play the record again. But getting to the end of the record is just one reason to replay this record. It's also catchy as hell at times. Comical. Entertaining, even. Don't be surprised if you absentmindedly ask yourself under your breath, "Have you ever seen a junior john?"

It's of course not for everyone. It can be grating. It will drive some people crazy.

Let's face it, Death Killers. There was filler among the killer. I've attempted to find the jeweler in the rougher.
