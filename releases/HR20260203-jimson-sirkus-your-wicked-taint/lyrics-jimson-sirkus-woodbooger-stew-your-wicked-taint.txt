Jimson Sirkus - Woodbooger Stew (Your Wicked Taint)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
[Verse 1]
	Step right up, test your skill,  
	For Sirkus hounds, it’s time to swill!
	Sideshow fiends with phantom limbs,  
	Barkin’ out sea sick Sirkus hymns!
	Scum Puppy whispers, "pull my finger"
	Just a Hoobie hustler, the aroma lingers!
[Pre-Chorus 1]
	It’s a three-card Hoobie hustle, Sirkus shell-game trick!
	We’re tha Jimson crew rockin’ the demented and sick!
	Ringmaster’s laugh, blows a hole in your colon, 
	Scum puppy’s spit leaves them all swollen!
	Bally busts a nut with a three foot drop,
	Hokey Pete’s bass makes the cooters pop!
[Chorus 1]
	Like Corpsewood Manor Slag, Slag!
	We summon tha Boo Hag, Hag!
	And South Carolina Haint, Haint!
	To haunt your wicked Taint, Taint!
[Verse 2] 
	Fire-eatin’ Yeti meat with an undead moan,
	Our Sirkus stench makes Sasquatch groan!
	Viscious and dapper and telling’ no lies,
	Hoobie schemers in a carny disguise!
	Check our recipe for Woodbooger stew,
	Served up fresh at the Jimson zoo!
[Pre-Chorus 2]
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
[Chorus 2]
	Like Corpsewood Manor Slag, Slag!
	We summon tha Boo Hag, Hag!
	And South Carolina Haint, Haint!
	To haunt your wicked Taint, Taint!
[Bridge]  
	Welcome to the Night of the Giving Head,
	Flesh eating Hoobie orgy of the living dead!
	Big top’s burnin’, from a finger blastin’ ghost,
	No lie, ask your mama, she loved it most!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
	Slag!, Hag!, Haint, Taint!
[Chorus 3] 
	Like Corpsewood Manor Slag, Slag!
	We summon tha Boo Hag, Hag!
	And South Carolina Haint, Haint!
	To haunt your wicked Taint, Taint!
	Like Corpsewood Manor Slag, Slag!
	We summon tha Boo Hag, Hag!
	And South Carolina Haint, Haint!
	To haunt your wicked Taint, Taint!
[Outro]  
	Hoodoo!, Hoodoo!
	Hoodoo!, Hoodoo!
	Hoodoo!, Hoodoo!
	Hoodoo!, Hoodoo!
