Scum Puppy - Do You Wanna Pet My Bear?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	We’ve been stuck too long, actin’ all withdrawn,
	Like you ain’t see the beast I’m holdin’.
	I’m a wilderness man, got a furry-ass plan,
	And my bear’s needs love that’s golden.
[Pre-Chorus]
	Late night shine, moon so bright,
	Got a grizzly with love to spare.
	Small talk’s weak, skip the technique,
	Just tell me if you dare.
[Chorus]
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet my bear, where?
[Verse 2]
	Every king needs a throne, this bear’s overgrown,
	Bigger than your couch, I swear.
	Knees on the deck, yeah, I’m beggin’ for respect,
	Run your hands through his lair.
[Bridge]
	My, my, my, honey and rye,
	Don’t it make him growl so right?
	Wrong or strong, hear his midnight song,
	Ain’t no time for stage fright.
[Chorus]
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet my bear, where?
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet my bear, where?
[Outro]
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet my bear?
	Do you wanna pet?
	Yeah!
	Do you wanna pet him there?
