Scum Puppy - My Testimony of the Paranormal Pole Shiner

Lyrics:

	In the heart of a rundown city, there was an adult movie theater known for its dim lights and questionable clientele. It was the kind of place where the scent of stale popcorn mixed with a hint of desperation. Regulars called it “The Hole,” and for many, it was a refuge. Among them was Scum Puppy, a nickname he earned for his unshakeable urge to seek pleasure in the most unexpected places.

	One evening, Scum Puppy settled into his usual spot, a sticky seat in the back row. The movie flickered to life, and he lost himself in the on-screen antics. But tonight felt different. A chill danced through the air, and the lights flickered ominously.

	Then, he noticed it. A shadowy figure appeared at the glory hole on the wall, just a few feet away. It was a ghostly silhouette, ethereal and shimmering. Scum Puppy squinted, half-expecting a prank or a trick of the light. But there it was, unmistakable—the Gloryhole Ghost.

	“Hey there, big boy,” the ghost whispered, voice like silk and smoke.

	Scum Puppy’s heart raced. Was this for real? He leaned closer, curiosity overpowering caution. The ghost beckoned him, and against his better judgment, he stepped up to the hole. What happened next was beyond anything he had ever imagined.

	A wave of eerie energy surged through him. The ghost reached through, sending shockwaves of sensations that felt both foreign and exhilarating. Scum Puppy’s laughter mingled with gasps as the ghost engaged him in a wild dance of pleasure and laughter. It was darkly comedic; he never thought he’d find himself flirting with a paranormal entity in an adult theater.

	But the fun took a turn. The ghost had a mischievous side. Suddenly, Scum Puppy found himself experiencing bizarre scenarios. The screen behind him transformed into a warped carnival of shadows. He was surrounded by ghostly figures, some laughing, others moaning. They all seemed to want a piece of him.

	Scum Puppy’s eyes widened. Was he in heaven or hell? The thrill mixed with a tinge of fear. He was now the star of a twisted show, with the ghost leading the way.

	“Join us!” the Gloryhole Ghost chimed, as the other spirits swirled around him.

	Just as he was about to lose himself completely, a loud crash echoed through the theater. The lights flickered back to life, and the ghostly figures vanished, leaving Scum Puppy panting in confusion.

	The theater was empty. Scum Puppy stumbled back to his seat, heart still racing. Had it all been a dream? Or was he just another victim of the Gloryhole Ghost?

	As he left the theater, a smirk crept onto his face. No one would believe his story. But he knew the truth—he would return. After all, who could resist a ghost that promised both pleasure and a good laugh?

	And so, the legend grew. The glory hole at that seedy theater became known for more than just its questionable films. Locals whispered about Scum Puppy and the Gloryhole Ghost, making it a place of both mystery and dark humor.
