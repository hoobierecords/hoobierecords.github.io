Description:
	The Mixtape Vol. 2 is the hard-hitting second release from B.C.D. So Gayngsta on Hoobie Records, following up on the raw energy of his debut, The Mixtape. Rooted firmly in uncompromising rap and hip-hop, the album delivers gritty street narratives, unfiltered emotion, and heavy beats across eight tightly packed tracks. Songs like “Shoot This In Between Your Toes,” “Chasin That High,” and “Drug Addicted But Gifted” showcase B.C.D.’s blunt lyrical style, blending themes of struggle, addiction, ambition, and survival with sharp delivery and stripped-down production.
	The project also features production contributions from Scum Puppy on “Tired Of The Queer Shit” and Tori Fixx on “Gun Shots And Scattered Lead,” adding distinct sonic textures while maintaining the album’s aggressive tone. Tracks such as “Kryptonite” and “Hatred” close out the record with intense lyricism and heavy atmosphere, reinforcing the project’s raw, unapologetic identity. The Mixtape Vol. 2 stands as a continuation of B.C.D. So Gayngsta’s gritty aesthetic—direct, controversial, and grounded in hard-edged hip-hop realism.
