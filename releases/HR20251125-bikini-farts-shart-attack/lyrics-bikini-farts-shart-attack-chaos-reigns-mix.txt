Bikini Farts - Shart Attack! (Chaos Reigns Mix)

Lyrics:

[Verse]
	Dark winds howl,
	Whispers bite.
	Shadows creep,
	No end in sight.
	Echoes crack,
	Truth divides,
	Foul stench brews where secrets hide!
[Pre Chorus]
	Silent waters,
	Bubbling deep.
	A rupture,
	A blast,
	No peace to keep!
[Chorus]
	Bikini Farts,
	A storm untamed!
	Exploding skies,
	The world’s aflame!
	Silent,
	Deadly,
	Chaos reigns!
	Bikini Farts!
	There’s no escape!
[Verse 2]
	Muffled cries,
	The depths awake.
	Hidden power,
	The ground will shake.
	Sulfur dreams,
	A burning wave.
	A toxic hymn,
	We can’t be saved!
[Pre Chorus]
	Fissures cracking,
	Earth betrayed.
	Unleash the beast,
	The price is paid!
[Chorus]
	Bikini Farts,
	A storm untamed!
	Exploding skies,
	The world’s aflame!
	Silent,
	Deadly,
	Chaos reigns!
	Bikini Farts!
