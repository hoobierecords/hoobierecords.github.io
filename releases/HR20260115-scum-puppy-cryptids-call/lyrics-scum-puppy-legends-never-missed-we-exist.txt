Scum Puppy - Legends Never Missed (We Exist)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
	Step heavy like Sasquatch, footprints in the concrete.
	Fangs out, Chupacabra, hunger where the beat meet.
	Slide-glide shadows, Fresno Night Crawlers creep.
	Fog on the moor, Beast Of Dartmoor don’t sleep.
	Billabong bounce with the Bunyip in the water.
	UK grime howl, Beast Of Bodmin Moor slaughter myth talk.
	Northwest grit, Skookum got the frame.
	Lakeside bark, Michigan Dogman bring the flame.
	Twin Cities snarl, Minnesota Dogman growl.
	River coils up, Ogopogo break the prowl.
	Jungle small but mean, Orang Pendek strike quick.
	Swamp scales hiss, Scape Ore Swamp Lizard Man slick.
[Chorus]
	What’s that move in the treeline?
	CRYPTIDS!
	What don’t die, don’t bleed, don’t sleep?
	CRYPTIDS!
	Say the name—feel the fear!
	CRYPTIDS!
	Legends live—we right here!
	RIGHT HERE!
[Verse 2]
	Deep loch ripple, Loch Ness Monster rise.
	Sky drum clap, Thunderbird cut the skies.
	Pine Barrens sprint, Jersey Devil on dash.
	Cold wind whisper, Wendigo in the ash.
	Heartland stomp, The Missouri Monster charge.
	Shoreline murk, Dewey Lake Monster large.
	Ice crown bars, Yeti keep it colder.
	Bayou twice told, Honey Island Swamp Monster shoulder.
	Outback echo, Yowie in the dust.
	Night scream rings, Enfield Horror earn trust.
	Cornfield blur, Ohio Grassman roam.
	Clawline slick, Wampus Cat guard the zone.
[Chorus]
	Who outside when the moon go red?
	CRYPTIDS!
	Who stay fed off the fear instead?
	CRYPTIDS!
	From the swamp—
	TO THE PIT!
	From the myth—
	WE EXIST!
	WE EXIST!
	WE EXIST!
	LEGENDS NEVER MISSED!
[Verse 3]
	Texas lake lurk, Lake Worth Monster stare.
	Small-town odd, Loveland Frog Man rare.
	Canyon drumbeat, Mogollon Monster knock.
	Midwest sprint, Beast Of Bray Road clock.
	Beach-borne buzz, Montauk Monster tale.
	Red-eye omen, Mothman trail.
	Chill-town flash, Dover Demon glance.
	Railway myth, Pope Lick Monster stance.
	Arkansas roots, Fouke Monster roam.
	Desert coil threat, Mongolian Death Worm tone.
	OG stomp back, Bigfoot on cue.
	Border water glide, Lake Champlain Monster too.
[Chorus]
	What’s that move in the treeline?
	CRYPTIDS!
	What don’t die, don’t bleed, don’t sleep?
	CRYPTIDS!
	Say the name—feel the fear!
	CRYPTIDS!
	Legends live—we right here!
	RIGHT HERE!
[Bridge]
	Howls in the hills, Ozark Howler call.
	Backroad horns up, Goatman stand tall.
	Old-world grit, Almas hold ground.
	Moonlit shift, Loup Garou spin round.
[Verse 4]
	UFO glow, Flatwoods Monster shine.
	Swamp funk swing, Skunk Ape align.
	Crooked-wing hiss, Snallygaster swoop.
	Northwoods grin, Hodag in the loop.
	Bayou mask on, Rougarou slide.
	Ridge-run grit, Tennessee Wildman stride.
	Port city lore, Wolf Woman Of Mobile move.
	Iowa lights, Van Meter Visitor groove.
	Indiana splash, Beast Of Busco flex.
	Little-folk strike, Pukwudgie vex.
	Bayou encore, Honey Island Swamp Monster repeat.
	Legend after legend, every cipher complete.
[Chorus]
	Who outside when the moon go red?
	CRYPTIDS!
	Who stay fed off the fear instead?
	CRYPTIDS!
	From the swamp—
	TO THE PIT!
	From the myth—
	WE EXIST!
	WE EXIST!
	WE EXIST!
	LEGENDS NEVER MISSED!
[Outro]
	No cap, all myth, every name got weight.
	Hardcore cryptozoology, folklore heavyweight.
	From campfire tales to the subwoofer thump.
	Scum Puppy make the monsters march—now the legends bump.
